When I was 11 years old, I was a day of the sounds of laughter.
My father heard on his little, white radio show on the BBC's website.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual, because he was very popular to the news.
He called "The Taliban are coming."
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obvious that my father did, very happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said.
I never forget this morning.
A right school.
The Taliban had been able to go to Afghanistan when I was six, and they were not paying to go to school.
So I was so short for my age as a boy and my older sister who had not been able to be a secret school.
It was just the way we could go to school.
Every day we took another way to think that nobody could have to guess where we went.
We were going to put our books in a high-tat, so it looked like we'd just go to a car.
We were in a house where we were in 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a terrible, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were given our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the students had to go back for a week because the Taliban had a second.
We never knew how much it knew us about us.
Are they going to be?
Did they know where we live?
We had fear, but we didn't want to go to school.
I had a great lucky job in a family where education became important and daughters.
My grandfather was very far at the time.
A war from a high-war war. He was in his daughter -- my mother -- and was sent to school and was sent by his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
It's.
Two years ago, she went to the workforce, just to move our house for school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here was the first family who had ever been a school education.
For him, he was really clear that his children would get education, even though the Taliban were, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of your children not to send school.
I know that I was sometimes frustrated in the Taliban, sometimes, as frustrated as a life, from the unaware of fear and the informality.
I had a good joke, but my father said, "Mold, listen to me. You can lose it in your life.
You can get money. You can get fired in war from your house.
But one thing you're going to get is: what's in here. And when we're going to pay to pay with our blood care for your home.
So -- you know, you want to give me a question?"
Today, I'm a 14 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
A half-year-old women's age, a higher age, and when my family didn't have been used to be so much for my education, I would have been a part of this women.
Instead I'm here, as a very proudist of the New Yorker.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was arrested by his family because he gave his daughters to send his daughters to school, one of the first things that I was sent to.
He's not just a school student, but also, I was the first woman and I'm the first woman who goes through the car with a car in Seattle.
My family believe me.
I have big dreams, but my family has a bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global minister for 1010, a global campaign for women.
So I helped to start to start the first high-tech and maybe the only business of girls in Afghanistan, a country in school, is still a child for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school are trying to find a lot of effort to find them a lot of potential.
And to see how their parents and fathers are in the course of my parents, including all the time, and by the end of the end of the day.
It's like a professor. It's not really the name, and I can't show his face, but Robert is a father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter was on the home of the city of the city of the city in the village, and they're the death of a bomb just for a few minutes.
When he went home, the phone came in, and he took a voice, and he sent him back to school, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try to try it again.
He said, "Take me now if you want to go, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's phone for the moment of your old and unintived ideas."
What Afghanistan did, so I realized something that is often more often going to be told in the West: the rest of us, the success is, the father, the value of his daughter, and that's the value of his daughter, is that it's success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers don't play a critical role in our success.
They're often often more likely to get out of the ones that are more sensitive and more compelling for their own future, but in a society like in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, the support of men.
The Taliban went to a few hundred-year-old girl -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls are going to be the school.
Afghanistan is looking at America, so different.
The Americans recognize how vulnerable changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not limited and moving on the U.S. population.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in school, and their parents who are trying to use them, then I see a very recent future and a whole-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the most unfinished opportunities, and remember me, and remember the girl who went to the Great Space.
It's like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, but I'm also a life -- my life was inspired by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1977, and in 1977, I see it's old, but I'm not -- I have -- I have a -- in Sambia, Kenya, the Northwest, and the North Valley, and the University of the California is working with the technical collaboration with African media.
I worked for a Italian U.S. and every project we asked on the legs, we failed.
I was really worried.
I thought, 21 years ago, we thought that we are a modern people and good work in Africa.
Instead of killing everything we did.
Our first project, which was my first book called "Cad, who was inspired by the S<unk>amp, who we wanted to show in the Italian, which is how to be used to be used to be food.
We came to the Italian seed in South America, and in this valley, which is the way that the Jianan is doing. We used to teach the local population of the local population and the Asian and the Colas.
Of course, the local community had no interest, so we were paid for work, and sometimes they started.
We were surprised that there was no amount of mass mining.
But instead of asking why they don't have any money, we just said, "Oh, thank you that we are here."
"Bore time, to save people from the Sistineia."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this great-grandbic, in Italy, they were so large, in Sambia, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and they said, "Look, how agriculture is,
When the nuclear is red and red, it came out about 200 o-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and
We said to the Solas: "Oh God, the pier!"
And they said, "Yes, because we don't have agriculture here."
"Why don't you tell us?" You never asked us."
I just thought we were a great, very good, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did. When I saw what they did, what they saw, what they were pretty proud about in the project in the New York.
We're at least the pier.
They should see the wrong -- you should see the wrong thing that we have no human-Americans.
They should read the book "The Sistine Aan" from the Kolas, she's a traditional economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent in the last 50 million years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was made.
You just read their book.
You know, read from a African, which we've been beaten.
We are Western people, of course, ancient, international, and there are only two species that we deal with people. We're also a biococicist, or we're a non-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-
Both words are from the Latin "in" which means "food" means "food."
But they have two different meanings.
In general, I'm a different culture than they were my children. I love you so much."
Patocus: I'm going to make a different culture than they were my gay.
So white people in Africa are called "The Spood," "Jeopardy."
I was a little bit more uncomfortable when I read the book "The "wood"" and he said, in the economic development, especially if people don't want to help them.
This is the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Today, the guy who opened this conference, a bus on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't the non-furial.
When I was a young age, I decided to respond to people and created a system called the business, which is never allowed to be a little bit more partner, but you will be a public-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-
What you do -- you get the mouth.
You never have a community of ideas, you get together with the local.
We don't work from offices.
We're going to meet in cafeteria. We're going to meet ourselves in Kaw in Kaw.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're looking at friends and finding what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can take a idea of somebody.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you do?
The work for your own growth is the most important.
The work for your own food is the most important of humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had a case of many years ago: Why instead of going to a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community workers.
They never have a lot of education, and they never will say the public, which they want to do with their money, what they want to see for them.
So the server has a blind line.
The most popular people in the community don't know because they never looked at public meetings.
We work one to do that, you have to be created a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the family of the company that is the house of the house that you're sitting in your house and in the cafeteria, help you to find the tools that are going to transform your passion in a way.
I have this in the field of the West, the West Bank, trying to try.
I was a long time, and I tried to say that the flipple, where we say other things that they should be done to be out of.
And so I went through the first year, and I had the streets, and in the first three days, I brought him. He took a little fish in a garage, he was a Japanese, and I brought to a restaurant in a restaurant, and they told you, "You know, you're going to help you help the Japanese."
I helped you work with the five fish, and this wonderful satellite is not going to sell a factory in Kenya for a half-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-a-a-a-a-
In a year, I had 14 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, really, really,
I'm going to hear the mouth and hear them."
So -- so -- so the government says, "Look again."
We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've been developing 40,000 companies in the workforce.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be a plastic.
Peter Hillis, one of the best business workers in history died with 14 years ago.
Peter Hillis was a philosophy of philosophy before he started with companies. Peter Hillis said, "Dock is actually unaware of a professional society and economics."
Design is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build a mad-up, not knowing what the most human man's favorite man's man's man's life, and you want to do with their money.
You have to learn how to get that up to get a place.
You have to offer them and privacy. You have to be great to help them, and they're going to get a lot of them.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people who are intelligence and passion?
For example, what you've heard about is the most stressful now?
<unk>Audience<unk><unk>s great people. You've got this.
I want to say that entrepreneurs is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the more autonomous fossil fuels, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The failure of the engine is not sustainable.
The unimp-foodation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, we can use to produce and produce them with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? I'm sorry.
The government? You're sorry!
It's a entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a scientific magazine for many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1984,
In 18 years, they came together and they started with a little bit of, which would happen in the city of New York. The conclusion was that the city was not a popular statement: The city would not exist in New York City.
Why? You saw the curve and said, if the population grows in this speed, they needed six million cows to be free, and it would be impossible to be done with the black fish.
Because they went in the dung.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that's going from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, before we had 100 dollars per dollar -- 100 dollars per year.
The idea of finding a different technology, there was little factories in the country.
S<unk>amp, Mozart. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing is that they need to be sent to them.
And they don't come and talk to you.
So next, you have to give them the most ideal, un-dan, passionate and creative service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurs.
From the smallest city, all the new companies have to be able to take three things: the product needs to sell the cost of the market and the financial services.
If you know?
We never met a single person who can produce something that can sell and sell money.
That's not something that doesn't exist.
This person never heard.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100-Americans in the world -- Long, the Long, the Long, the Watson, the new companies, Google, Microsoft, and Microsoft.
There's only one thing that has been invented all the successful companies in the world, just one: No one of them was just a person.
Now, we teach 12-year-old entrepreneurs in North America, and we start to start the students, to give them the first sides of Richard Brettics. The task is the year of the year-s-old, the first two-year-old, which is how it's used to use "s" and how often used to use "The word"
No one, and 32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one was a company. No one.
So we can create a community that has a small-class background in the cafeteria, and you're sitting in the cafeteria, and you're sitting in the lunch, and you're going to do what someone who has done for you, you know, "What are you going to have to say?"
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't say, "Look, you know I'm thinking you're thinking for someone?"
We're using communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping the companies to help them, to help people, and we found that the miracles of the local intelligence, that the community can change the economy and the community of the community, just by creating a creative relationship of their own.
Thank you.
For five years, I've learned how it should be, Alice in the English country.
The University of Columbia, I asked myself -- a national deal for communication -- online students in communication.
I had fear -- I had fear.
The right fear. They were teaching their students with their big brains and their great books, and they don't have any common word of words.
But when the conversations started, he turned me out how he was going to go down to the hospital and saw a door to a new world.
I felt like I was going to come up with the students. I was curious about the thoughts that they had had had, and he wanted to find that other miracles in the country.
I think to open this door, it needs great communication.
We need to need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the biggest problems, like energy and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it doesn't understand it. I think it's a responsibility for our leadership.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't teach us to teach us in their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you some pieces of tasks that you can do, that we can see that science and technology that you're talking about, and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, right?
And let's say why your scientific area is so important for us.
Not only tell us that their sperm is, but also tell us that your mother's body-like structure, because they study it, because they're important to understand and treat and treat.
And if you understand what you do, you get away.
We're a result of understanding of your mind.
And you know, you could use it, you know, you know, you know, but why you don't just say, "y Life," and you know what's much more accurate for us?
We're going to make your thoughts understand, not the same way you're going to get off.
As Einstein said, "Moo-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
You can tell us something about your scientific area without being involved.
A few things are to find: examples of stories and text and analysis, so that you can put in your mind.
And if you start with your work, then you take the line.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "Eject."
What happens if someone is looking for? Another one is going to be a couple of points, and with these dots, you know, your audience.
One slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very hard to talk about the work of our brain, and it's very rapidly.
This is a lot more effective, of the genes of Google Hillis. It shows that the specific structure is so efficient that they were also the inspiration for the design of the keyboard.
The trick here is a single sentence of using a specific sentence that can lose the audience when it can lose the text, and the images that are also able to be a different way of understanding what they're looking at.
These are just a few pieces of tasks that can help us to open the door and see the wonder country that science and technology.
There's the engineers I've taught to teach me, I've taught me to make a little bit more connected in my head, I want to start with anything with a equation.
You see, you see about science and your text, you're going to get through the subject, so the audience says, what's important with passion and the work of your work, and you've done with your work, and you've got a very sophisticated approach of new things.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and a personal freedom.
You can read a cell phone, you can write a crime in the U.K.
You can go to a phone, you can start a message and start a meeting in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, it's going to be a high-up game, and you're famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1986, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of people went to the street and hit.
We are in the winter, and we've been looking at that all these people who were coming from and asked, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Just take it up.
You're going to take your cell phone, you're going to get a big!
Just take it up. A laptop, a baseball, wow.
These are many. Almost every phone has a phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 354 lines full of information.
Dimping data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.S. has been a line.
This is a law of law enforcement.
This is the law that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service company has to store a range of anti-driving.
Who calls who? Who are the email?
Who are the text of a text?
And if you use a cell phone, where you're.
All of these information will be used for least six months to two-year-old companies or your Internet phone phone phone.
And everywhere in Europe, people were sitting up, and they said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to get this competition.
We want to be a self-time act of the digital age, and we don't want to say that the phone companies and Internet services need to store all of these information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, journalists who said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how many people on the streets of Berlin and they said, "woodess of fear."
And some people even said that this could be a <unk>amp; is a <unk>O.
The Rolas was the p-foodi in the Eastwest.
And I also ask myself whether that really works.
Can you really use all this information about us?
Every time I use my phone phone?
So I asked my phone company that was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, let me take all of the information that you've been beaten me up with me.
And I asked her, and she asked her back, and he didn't get a right answer. It's just a little bit of light.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that you have to do it.
So I decided to put a process against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the New Yorker said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was a comparison to them.
I'm going to get back the back of what they've done to send me all the information.
Because in the meanwhile of the federal government, the test was the law of the Great Act was the right-called German law.
So I got this terrible brown to the clock.
And on the CD, that was.
354 lines on information.
So first, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge record. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this stage.
So I was a little bit curious, what do I start with this?
Because you see where I'm in night I'm sitting in my bed.
But then I said, I want to go to this information on public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what the drought means is a free.
So with online and open data, I've done this.
This is a collection of six months of my life.
You can zoom down and zoom, you can go back and go back.
You can do one step, and I can do it,
And you can see how I'd go from the train to the train of the car to the car, and how many calls I do.
All of this is possible to do with this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just going to call my wife and call me me me and we're talking about a few times.
And then I'm going to call a couple of friends and they're calling each other.
And after a while, you call it and you call it, and we have this huge network.
But you can see how people communicate each time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see anything.
You can see the central figures, like the leaders are.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, how you can train a society because you know who you're talking to who is a email, all of you can do is to have access to this information.
And this information is at least six months, in Europe, to two years.
As I started at the beginning, we started to ask that all these people in the streets of the car phones in 1984, were in their pocket.
And the Rolas had heard who was in the stage, and if the McDonald's had been heard who the leaders were, then that's never happened.
The case of the Berlin, the museum could not have been there.
And yet, not the case of the Sistine Tolas.
Because the national authorities and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and so forth.
They want to share the possibility of being able to collect our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But even self-time and life in digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
You have to fight for that day.
So if you go home, you say your friends, you're privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not a old.
If you go home, you say, you're not only the companies and national beings, you have to use certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone companies to get the information you've got about it.
So in the future, every time you use your phone, remember that you have to fight to fight the self-time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Confood, rapid-time camps, mour, mour.
So the city's program, and they started to change the name of South Central Central, so he's going to get a different thing, it changed in South Los Angeles, which changes something that changes in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Now, in the air-tood, rapid-time camps, the spring.
As two-year-old Americans live in the food of South Central California, the home of Dr.
The old thing is that the Dr.D. is that the Dr. is more people kill people than the Dr.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the unknown diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times more than a half-mood, which is about 15 miles.
I couldn't get that up with a lot.
And I asked myself how you would feel if you had no access to food if you go from the house, the negative effects that have been made on your food system.
I used to buy a pumble and sell the way that the flies are sold.
I see a conversation of art spaces like Starbucks.
And I realized that this must stop.
I realized that the problem is.
D is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a funny job to get a second-term score to get a apple that is not with a non-food.
So I took a food bomb before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to have to have it.
So I think, "Core. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to be in."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and I came to the group. The T.L. Green D. and we started to start with my food, and they're going to plant, and they're going to plant, and they're going to plant the whole program, you know, you know, we're a lot of the way to get a lot of the way.
We are a way of a set of a group of group, together, together from all the social parts and from the city, it's completely accessible and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is more concerned.
The city came to me and he was actually a constant trip, and he said that I need to get my garden, that I was a complete-up-up.
And I thought, "Look, right?
A single-freating of food consumption on a piece of food that you're absolutely not true?"
And I thought, "Core. He's doing that."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The T.A. Times got the wind. Steve Lolas made a story about it and talked to the city and talking to a member of Green to the roof. They were a prototype on the P.C. and we were successful.
We thought the enemy was in the hands.
My city was even called, and he said they support it and love what we do.
So, why should they do that?
L.C. in the United States, most of the bresties in the city.
They have a hundred miles of the backway.
These are 20 Central Park.
It's enough area to plant 600 million nuclear gas plants.
Why should they find that not good?
It's a plant that you can get 1,000, 1,000 seeds.
With green meat, you get a dollar and vegetables in 65 dollars.
It's my boss, I'm going to say people who are going to grow their own food.
He's going to be able to use their own food to fly as their own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I got my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this unconcessable reality that was made by other people and I'm going to be a pore my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
The arts is my brother. I collect my art.
It's like a graffiti artist who's left the walls, I'm going to get a little bit of the walls and the air plant.
I use the garden that are a piece of stuff, and the plants are the trees and the trees are the rest of these stuff.
They would be surprised by what the Earth can do, if you use it as a piece of paper.
You can't imagine how amazing sun is a sun-like, and how they hide people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was a tool for education and the environment of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the flow of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be wondering how children are influenced by it.
And the most popular ones are the most open and cool act that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get a double-up.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter came, it was about 10 in my backyard, and they were over my backyard, and I looked at it.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know you don't have to do that.
The garden isn't just a reason on the street."
I've been embarrassed when I saw people who are so close and hungry, and that has just been the most vulnerable to do. People said, "You know, you don't have sex to eat your food."
And I said, "There's no, no, I don't have fear that they're going to be.
It's the road.
Now, that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time I want you to get back to their health."
In a different time, I took a garden in this war in the R.C. in the R.C.
These are the guys who helped me to put the Tail.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how they've been influenced and how they've been raised with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it has changed it, even though it's a moment.
Green Dolas has been covered for 20 villages.
In order to get out of our own species, 50 people came and made it all the volunteers.
If kids grow, children eat a gas.
If they grow fruit flies, they eat fruit gas.
But if they're not invited to get a little bit of them, if they're not shown how food and body bodies, they eat what you're going to be blind with.
I see young people who want to work, but they sit in this thing -- I see color kids who are at the same way they're in the same way they're in and they're not going to get it.
The people I see as a chance of training these kids can train their communities to lead to a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carel.
But if we don't change the flow of the Earth, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do.
I want to share a whole neighborhood of the spaces where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a ship and turn it into healthy TV.
So you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-tick, because free is not sustainable.
The ideal of sustainability is that you have to be able to keep it.
I'm talking about people who are working, and children, and they're learning to experience the joy and the fear of the fear and the honor, if you're building your own food to build food, and when you're building farmers.
So what I want to do here is this is a sexy.
I want to say that we're going to get all the natural, local, gang-class-class-class-class-class-class-class-class-class-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-class.
We need to move the image of the gang.
If you're not a man's seat, you're not a gang.
You're going to get a pumble, clear?
And let's take the gun of your choice.
If you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to go in the vets and make a meeting where you're talking about it, you're talking about it.
If you want to meet me, you're going to come with your bag, in my backyard, so we can plant some of the balls.
R.C. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite cartoons in the New Yorker is "The English" is "The Sistine Monist."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "The Soodyy" means "wood-food-food-food."
Although a newspaper of the 19th century, a better definition of an avatar: "Ayy is someone who is a party, of course, or a board, or a program, and the success of the unintedable power of the dominant.
I don't have any idea of what the gay body is.
Some of the words, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to be able to control language.
In 177, for example, the British British British British elections were not the same word of the guerrillas.
And that was actually the first time to the man's man with the extraordinary name of the name of the Solas, which is in the British Department.
They took him in the park, and they were a man who was a hard, but he was more difficult to stop, and finally he had so much support in London.
And only a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "wat" as much as Koodas."
Loodle on the English for a punge.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to a public press.
But to show you how words and politics are obsolete, I want to take you to go to the United States, and at the moment, when it's been done in the independence.
You saw the question of how you want to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leaders a national nation?
In Congress, it was a long time ago.
And there were all sorts of pre-term explanations.
I mean, some people wanted to call the Arab Washington, and others, his Japanese, Washington, and again, other freedom of the government of the people in America.
Not so a way of a mess.
Some people wanted to call him the king.
They thought that was a failure.
They weren't a non-curist, they wanted to choose the king for a specific time.
It could be done.
But every one was crazy because this debate was done three weeks ago.
I read the days of a meeting that's all the conversation: "I'm still going to write the same topic."
The reason for the left was the job, and the job was that the day was the head of the war was the war.
The protesters didn't want to be a place that Washington is going to be a good. They didn't want to do it.
The king calls, and maybe it may be a little bit more to get it on ideas.
They wanted to give him the most vulnerable, the most popular title that they could find.
This title was "The Recess."
President. They didn't invented the title. He didn't even mean that someone was a documentary.
It's like a pre-food.
He didn't have a scale than the "Jeopardy" or "mat"""
Sometimes, the president had smaller-scale and government groups, but it was really a non-food title.
So the end of the day was to get it out.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to be re-filled and military license.
Who will take it seriously if he has a nice title of the United States like President of America?"
And then after three weeks, the New Yorker was not a question.
Instead of being a non-food, the name of the title is to use "The Recession," but they wanted to really realize that they weren't so vulnerable to their beliefs and citizens, whether it's the state of the state of the United States, or the president of the United States, not to be a non-food, not to be a non-food, not to be a way of the president of the United States.
You can learn about three interesting things.
One -- and I think that's the best -- until now I don't find out if the Dutch ever described the title of the president.
Thomas Obama, President Obama, he's just a name. He's just waiting for the Dutch.
The second thing you can learn is that if a government says that something that is a rapid, you're waiting to get to be 1434,
Three, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of America is not so clever, right now?
This has been a little more than 5,000-food-food-food-food-through-through-through-through-food-s-s-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-freated-the-the-the-the-freated.
And the reality and history has been asked by the size.
And so the end of the day, the end of the day.
They have a legitimate title.
And the other worry about the act of the food, the sound of self-sood -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147, 147, 144.
Because they want to sound like the guy with the 5,000-tech droughts and so on.
So at the end of the day, the chief of the house, and nobody lost a more vulnerable, because nobody says that you're going to say that you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take you, and I'm going to leave you.
Now, politicians are trying to use words to form reality and control reality, but actually change the reality of words as words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came in a stage with about 50-year-old combat in the fight of the war, a 15-year-old, old-old, airlant, from Watson, Florida.
I'm going to see my black-and-old little-old pic-and-old p-in-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-in-and-and-in-and-in-and-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-and-and-in-in-in-in
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
and for a long time, I was born with war, but after the late, I was to go to Kolas and football and football and the pets with the South-class and the informalist, the non-foodist, the non-foodistististist, and the non-filled, and I knew that I knew that I had been able to do before I was a little bit of the conversation.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, a more, more, a-American, South-class, South-Americans. Aistist, a radical artist who has been working in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan, but I can't like to paint art, but I want to make art, and I want to make art and be able to make the character and re-discovered and re-in-created reality and even to try to understand people who are able to live in the world.
I want to spend a day in life of a product -- a public that is called the National Society, like "Batolese", and used to be used to be used to be a political and political and political.
And what else can do is the national plan as the president of the campaign and a choice for the text, "Let me do this." I'm rich."
And to use this campaign to use these Maolii, who are used to spend a national.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rove," where you take a frog, a false control of the streets of Seattle and the cars, but instead of giving them money from the police, and they hope that they're going to be able to be able to be able to be in the police of 200 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how conflict was in Afghanistan, I think, "The World Warian conflict."
The war and the fear of the memory that came to him, a new environment, and a way that you can only take is by a psychiatric and a drug attack for a suicide and a suicide bomin, I'm going to use a picid of the local-in-in-in-in-in-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-on-
And I would like to see how a simple little bit of paper from 12 to 18th-old Play-old, to create a dialogue about today, that today is the development of the development of the international conservation in the last-in-food, the man, and also have a little bit of a lot of war-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be more likely to be more unaware of it.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self.
This is my head. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Watson, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, right now.
I have a sense that now, in the room, there was a completely unfinished object, because I wouldn't have to be able to put this clothes.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of change.
This is the first time that someone is sitting on the TED stage, so you can be happy to see what I think.
If a few women were really excited when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I'll read this before I read Twitter.
I also realized that I'm a very lucky thing, because I can change a very short-term perspective of 10 seconds, which you think about me.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them.
The most difficult part is to get the black line of my head, because you'll all be careful, so you're not doing anything like my head.
Okay.
Why did I do that now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not just so uncomfortable as this picture.
It's a visual image, but a picture is also a very unimpable.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and a photographer told me I would go back and with my hand with my hair's hair's hair.
And of course, from the wrong-food, or the wrong-food that I've been doing two days for work, there are just a very few possibilities to change our own, and our "wood" is a very unimpable impact of our lives."
And I'm afraid of being honest for myself today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a beautiful white woman, and in my industry we call a smart girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered, but that means nothing.
The real reason I was a model is a profit in the genetic marriage and a critical legacy and maybe you ask what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only been as healthy and young and beautiful and visual, which is what we're using, but also as a large, lesbian and white-in-food.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that has been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are curious about this point, and maybe some kind of a sudden, some kind of a sudden, "Hook, Woody, Mr. Cloo. Hoo.
And then I'm first talking about your model. Very amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very successful student in the University of the University of the Long Lab has been given every single, and that every single one was taken by the number of pounds of a half-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-old, not know-a-
The next question that I'm going to be asked is, "Can I be a model if I'm a child?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give you these little girl is, why?
You know what? You can be.
You can be the first president of the United States or the inventor of the Internet or a famous-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-old, which would be the first one."
When they say that great deal, "No, no, I want to become a model," I say, "I'm going to be a model," I say, "Am my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the boss of American, or the business of H<unk>amp;amp; and the next S<unk>amp.
And then, you know, you want to say, you know, a model is like you would say that you want to win the guy in the E.S.
You can't change it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years ago, a model of a brain model, because it can be different than heart cancer, it can only be cut.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a little bit of a little bit-dot, and the driver says, "Mon, we want to go in the box," so the leg is going to go back and forth, and you can just start to get a little bit of thousands of friends, and you can just start to get back and you just get a little bit of thousands of friends.
It looks like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happening.
If you go to school, you have a life of life, and you can't say a lot more, you can't say that if you want to be the president of America, but you want to be a state of life, you're going to see, you're a little bit more weird.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Who are all the photos?"
And yes, so much of these photos are closed, but it's just a little part of what's happening.
This is the first photograph I did, and that was the first time I had a Byie. I had no time. I had my time.
I know that's pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before my grandmother.
I'm the day of this guy.
My friend had to be honest.
I'm on a Kafy party, a few days ago, a Saturday-up for a cartoon for the French elephant.
I'm a football team and a online team.
And I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's a tool, and it's a group of managers, from Kolas and the vicists and the guerrillas and the names and the rest of their clients and the production. It's not.
Okay, next, the people say, "You're going to get things for free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-year-old tea phone that I never can wear, except, but the things I'm free, things that I'm going to get to get to the real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a school, and I had my money. And you had my clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend with a terrible car, and they were on a red light, and of course we were beaten. It took a little bit of a sudden, "wood, Mr. Teszler, and we could go back.
I have the cost of the sound of my mind, and not because of my personality, there are people who are the same part of their mind and not for their personality.
I live in New York and from the 500,000 teenagers who were beaten and beaten, and they were 80 percent black and black men and old men.
It's not only 17,000 young young, black men and Latilla, not the question, "Who am I going to be crying?"
But I'm going to say, "How do I get married?"
And in my research, I found that 35 percent of the year-old girl don't like their body, and that number is over the bottom of the age of the year, when they're 17 percent.
The last question is, "What is it a model?"
And I think they expect that answer: "If you're a little bit cute hair and you feel very happy and beautiful."
And we give a answer that might be the idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great, creative, creative, creative people are working."
It's all right, but it's just half of the story, because we never tell you what I never told you before the camera, "I feel uncomfortable."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my view.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I be happier when I had little legs and bright hair?"
And then you want to meet a few-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
When I was a talk, it was very difficult to me, I realized that it was a more difficult, a more honest, because I felt very uncomfortable to get me and say, "I've got all the benefits of my wall, and it's always been so happy to make me feel that I'm not happy."
It was very difficult, a legacy of gender violence and race when I'm one of the largest incourse.
But I'm also happy and I'm proud to be here, and I think it's great that I've done this, and I've done it before 10 or 10 years old and my career, because I'm probably not going to tell you how I would be a job, or I would say, I'm not going to be a good job that I'm going to be born.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we hope that we all have the power of the image of the image of the image of the book, we're going to see the same thing that we're going to see in our mind and the wrongness.
Thank you.
I never met the words of my grandmother who was in the age of life, "Son, the pogah, the patisis.
But never to be like a Kafi revolution."
It's only two years ago, since the Holas Foundation, inspired by the waves of mass-food and in the Asian revolution.
I'm a lot of other, and I'm a lot of other, and in the outside of a sudden, to get a day of the anger and to start a revolution against the Dutch Union.
And there was a big revolution.
Boy, women and men were in the first series, the end of the authorities, they were asked by the freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have a very popular courage, by being asked by the most isolated terrorist bomber.
They showed a very difficult sense of a symbol of the Middle East, from the western West, until in the South.
Finally, after a period of old war, and almost 300 dead dead, we took our country to stop and to get the unconcession.
But Kafi has a great house, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation of the process.
Over four decades, Rolas had a local regime and the infrastructure, including the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The ritual and the challenges that I realized, I started to build as many women who are building the civil society, and we asked to create a more and more effective and more effective and a government and a crisis.
In 200 organizations, in the same time, they started to start and start to start to the case of Nurtah, in Ben, in Nuk, almost 300 in the case.
After 13 years, I came back to Ly, and I started to start to start with a unique self-food, and I started to start to create the interaction of the creative development, human development and leadership development.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peace-in-in-in-in-in-in-food, a movement of women, leadership, their own life, is to be the public-based, to be able to be the public-food-food-in-fist-food-in-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-
In the case of the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more powerful, a environment that was defined by the moral justice and being defined by terrorism.
I opened a campaign of peace capital, a local government to get a free driver, a law that is not going to choose to go to the background, and to the right, to the right and to the public and to the political, to the other female, to create a more powerful, to create a more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than a more
At the end of our campaign, our campaign was successful.
Women won to get a half-year-old military campaign in the first elections for 12 years.
But it was very clear, but the dominant elections of the elections, and the whole revolution for "and-day" we were looking for new news messages on violence.
And a morning, we were going to get the back of the re-up of the back-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up.
In another morning, we got the message about the British prime minister and the attack.
And again, another morning, the suicide bomders were sent by the army.
And we're really given by the law of the police and their progress against the rights of the rights and their laws of rules.
Our society, created a very common mind of a massive state, and it's largely driven by the principles of the laws and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, social justice, they were looking at it.
Beood, and the punge, the musical elephant were the "food" era.
I'm not here to inspire you to inspire the success of our success and the elections.
I'm also a lot of a lot of reason to say that we've been a nation that has heard the wrong choices.
We have a false message.
Because the elections didn't get peace or safety in Dyia.
Does the unconcession and the relationship between female and male leaders and national peace?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society be expanding and unconventional politics and the act of terrorism and men, and men, as women?
Maybe the women were not the only one who was wrong, but the female values of compassion, the S<unk>s and the sabyrinth.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a constant act of the elections that they needed to have the end of the polarization and the polarization.
Our society needs to have the unconcessive of the female as they need the informal, the informal, the gay, the gay.
We need to stop the name of the anger and have to have a day of the lunch.
We need to start in the name of empathy and the S<unk>amp.
We need to develop a female cycle that is not only allowed to accept the values, but also to be more than a vic, instead of collaboration, instead of a competition.
These are the ideals that needs to be a battle of war-tatyy-tatatia to get peace.
Because the peace has a Al-food, and in this case, it's the most of the cony and the couvic view.
This is the real thing.
And we need to do that, and we need to do it before we do it, we have to do it,
After a sentence from the Koran "The Life," the word of the gay God, "wood."
The word of the guerrillas, which is known in all the other Arab traditions, has the same Arabic "The Arabic" and the gay and the gay, the most vulnerable of humanity, the most of the female, and the female-in-food-fat-food-fat-f-food-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-food-f-f-f-food-f
And just like the mother's blood-in-o-o-o-o-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-a-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
So we said, "My favorite is all the things."
So we said, "My favorite man has been in my "mood."
Let's take all the stuff that you're going to get to the vyst.
Thank you.
When I was a small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "The Food."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're talking about the story of Steve and I've learned a lot about the world, except America, that America, we're the South Korea and the gods are victims.
And although I was lucky, how the world is, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea until I was able to spend a whole bit of time.
In the first time, I saw a public level, but I thought my life is normal in North Carolina.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to never suffer.
But in 1983, my mother took a letter from a friend of mine.
And then, if you were here, our five family family members will not be there, because we've been killed for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our body are so powerful that we're going to die later."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were in my country.
At short, I went back to the board, and I looked at something remarkable that I can't be able to cut away from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a half-old child was completely blind in their arm in his face.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy, they were in their families and their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a big war in North Korea.
At the end of the end, more than a million North Korea were blind in the victims, and many more sudden, because they were dead, they were eating the grass and the snowfish.
The electricity has been more likely to be so far as I was walking around the night, except the light of China's light from the other side of the quad, where we were born.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors on night.
This is the river of the center of the border as the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very, very, and it allows North Korea to be the ship.
But many who die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that when I was a young age of the war, I can get to the old age of the war to be killed by the death of the war to China.
I just thought I would be separated for my family.
I never thought that it needs 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be old, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but also because Northwest refugees are seen as a civil war.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would go back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my largest country was true when I was beaten by the military police and sent into the police.
Somebody told me, Northwest-Americans, so they tested my Chinese papers and asked me a lot of questions.
I had so scared, I thought I would be able to get my heart.
If you're a failure, I could be fired and be fired.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I made it my emotions and they'd ask questions.
After they were done with the papers, a citizen minister said, "That was a false deal.
It's not a Northwest."
And they gave me. It was a miracle.
Some North Korea, he's going to be a lot of the military messages in China, but many of the military police police police and swippled.
These girls had great happiness.
Despite the fact, they were finally released by the massive pressure of international pressure.
These North Korea didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, a lot of North Korea are covered in China and under North Korea, where they were replicated, or they're being executed,
Although I was lucky, it's not so many other North Korea.
It's a tragic that North Korea are going to hide their identity and fight hard for survival.
After they learned a new language and work, they can get their world in a moment.
After 10 years of the self-food, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had thought I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I also have the big difference between Northwest and South Korea.
We're all Japanese, but we have a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, from the part of the part of it.
I was a identity crisis.
Am I a South or Northwest?
Where are I going to come? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could be my home.
Although I was able to get the beauty of the Southwest life, I had just noticed a plan.
I was a recent job for the university.
Just as I was a new life, I got a curious call.
The North Soviet Union, the money that I took my family, and as a punishment was to get my family to go to a very remote place.
They had to be able to fly as fast as possible, so I started to plan their back.
North Korea have to get a incredible journey back to their freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. And unfortunately, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself back to the way to the eastern border.
Because my family didn't talk to them, I had to collect them more than 2,000 miles in China, and then after Southeast Asia.
The bus was a week, and we were just six times later.
One time the bus was sent to the bus, a Chinese police police police police police was in the board.
He took the point of all the time and started asking questions.
There was no Chinese father, I thought she would be released.
When the Chinese police police had my family, I said, "I'd be asked to him, and he said that she would be a pier, and I'm a pist.
He looked at me, but luckily, he believed me.
We took it to the Sistine border, but I had to put all my money to get the border of the Tolas.
But even after we had the border, my family was unplicated in the border, it was illegal to the battlefield.
After I had paid money and paid money, my family was a month, but shortly, my family was replicated in the local community.
This was one of the biggest efforts of my life.
I had done everything to get my family to the freedom of freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just just by the South-class message.
I went up and forth between the national authorities and the police department, trying to get my family, but I had no enough money to pay money or pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked my voice to a man, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is a common deal.
In a broken English, and with a dictionary, I decided to get my situation and not to go to a bank, and paid the money for my family and two-Americans to get out of jail.
I was invited to him from the heart of heart, and I asked, "Why do you help me?"
I don't want you." He said, "I'm sorry."
I'm going to teach the Northwest people."
I realized that this was a pretty special moment in my life.
The former stranger have been very helpful for me to make a new hope that the North Korea needed, and he showed me the friend of autism and the support of the international community as the best of the Japanese.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I started to get back in South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many North Korea are separated by their families and once they come into a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
The international community can help us work in education, the English, the education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside of the world, because many of us are still sitting in the family, and we send them information and money to change the money from North Korea.
I had a lot of lucky help and inspiration in my life that I want to be a more ambitious Northwest to be a more successful to be to be a lot of success.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful Japanese North Korea on the world, also in the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a game today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Si is two, and very good, very well-up.
It can't talk, but it can be the joy of joy, which is that some of the best songs could not be.
Sii knows what love is.
It's also a little bit uncomfortable, and it's going to make it unfinished.
It's not a non-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-cood.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and you just ask yourself, he never told you a lie.
When he's songs from our childhood, he's trying to write words, I'm still reminded myself, he reminds me a thing: How little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel is 17. He's very good. It's very good.
He has a absolutely unfinished memory.
But he also has a self-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
He can't remember if he had my chocolate hair, but he reminds me that he was a book from my baseball, a song, a little bit of books, when he was the first result of the pyston, and the first one of my mother's son and a woman.
Don't listen to it?
But many people don't want to be right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't be in the social version of normal, they often understood and wrong.
But what my heart has been taught, and my soul was that, although it was not even popular, it could be the only one that it could be, is that they were extraordinary and unusual.
Now, for those of you who don't care like the term of "coodism," it's a complex psychological disorder of the brain that are the social communication, the social learning, sometimes, the physical skills.
It's a different part of every individual, which is Sii, which is so different than Sam.
And in the world, all 20 minutes, the great person is autism, and although it's a common growing environment in the world, there's no doubt or failure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a kid, but I can't remember myself without a day.
I was just a three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a couple months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play how it did, and it was actually not really interested in me.
Sians lived in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things like cars in a series of machine, and they were going to eat everything.
And when he was older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the shony and the never-food-food-food-through-through-turity, a terrible and innocent natural natural nature, a boy who had never seen any human view.
Sadly, it's extraordinary.
Now, I can't have a lot of challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish I would be the same.
But I go back with the idea that they taught me about self-interest, relationships and love and love, and I understand that these things that I wouldn't want to be a natural act.
So the naturalness of beauty that are going to give us differences, and the fact that we're different is not that we're wrong.
It means that there's a different way of right.
And if I could only say a thing to you and tell you, you know, it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because you know, you know, you know, you know, the differences that we have -- we have a gift -- each one of us, in all of us, in the way of the general is the ultimate potential of the military victims.
The chance of scale, progress and change will be dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
And S<unk>onon was taught by curiosity and curiosity with this photo, with a apple's photo of a black pyst, and with a degree of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and seeing the world not only with a million or a billion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new way of photography that can take the P-D-D-D-D-s-D-s-s-s-D-s-s-s-s-D-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
And so we can build cameras that can look at the perspective of the screen or look at a-dimensional image in our body and actually ask what we call with "Mo."
Now, if I take a laser clip, and I'm going to take it in a second, and it's a little bit of a second -- it's a couple of-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by
So if you take this project, this neurosototot, and you take it in this bottle, how these images are going to fly in the bottle?
How light looks in the process?
So this whole event -- this is the event.
So you think that's actually a lot more event than a nanoscopic event -- so long, so it takes the light to get it back, but I'm going to get this video to see the size of 10 billion, so you can see the light.
No, Coca-Cola has not been funded this research.
So in this movie, a lot of time, so let me show you what's going to happen.
The pulse, our project, is going to be in the bottle of a supernova that starts to move through the back and then the inside.
One part of the light is out of the table, and you see that area of the waves.
A lot of the photons are finally going to get the piece of the bottle and fly in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air, the air that goes around the bottle.
In the same time, the waves are out of the table, and because of the sound, you see that the reflection of the fly are focused on a few images.
If you take a great project, and you can take it back and slow it back the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A week, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- by a slow project in movement.
And what about something like this is a life-time photographer?
You can see how these waves are the table, the bridge and the wall on the background.
It's when you put a mountain in a bus.
And I was looking at this as the nature would paint a photo, a little-up image, but of course, our eye is a specific image.
But if you look at this Tom's second, you'll see that when the light goes out, you get the light, you're going to get it, you're not going to get dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is a second, and the light goes back and back to a few seconds.
So in the future, if this little-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
So how did my team build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short period of time, you have very little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your most recent area, so you don't know how to do that light.
So we're doing this: We're going to send this project, this is a project, and we're looking at a thousand-foot-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-
And we can take all these things, and they can do very interesting things.
So, McDonald's.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how would it be a new brand for a future-like green-like, can you see the lines?
The idea is that we're going to put a little light on the door.
It's going to go in the room, and it's part of it, and then it's going to be back to the door, and then we could use that more extracellularized of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We actually built it.
The left is the next-by-by-by-by-by-by-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-old camera.
The wall is a pony, and we'll get the light on the door.
After our paper, the National Rights Foundation was published, it was made by the C.C.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to get this light project, and they're going to get this wall and they're going to put these neurosons and put some of the photons in the back, and they're going to get some of the light, and then the light will be a part of the bridge, and then they'll get a little bit of the tiny, but they'll get a little bit more interesting, but they'll get a little bit more interesting,
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our mobile camera has a unique ability.
It has a very good time of progress, and it can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the color of objects, but we don't know what's going on.
So by looking at a laser, we can take a plastic-up version that you can see -- just like the screen -- but if we do some of these images, these images, and they try to analyze the different light-like light-like light, we can see that object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our design process.
We have a lot of time to do before we can do the lab in practice, we could build cars, and see what's the line is, or what's on the curve, we can look at dangerous groups, by looking at the way of the light, or we can actually build the window, and we can actually build it in the center of the body, and we can see it,
But because of the pabyrinth and tissue, of course, that's a very challenging reason for scientists, now, is the math of scientists, now, thinking about Pimp-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-the-the-the-the-the
So, like Cillon, a different example, even a scientist, is a art of art, a art sculpture, and I realized that all of these nanoss, we can't use the data that we can only use the scientific animation of the digital form, and we can also take a new piece of paper, and we can't just take a new piece of time.
But it's also a funny thing.
If you look at these waves under the foot, you see that the waves are coming away from us.
The waves should be moving.
What happens here?
It turns out that we have almost a light-like effects, weird effects and Einstein would have seen this picture.
The way that happens in the world is, in the camera, it's going to happen in a process of processing, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can predict that.
So whether it's a journey of photography or the design of a new collection of medicine, or new stages, we have all the data and the details of our website, and hope that the traditional-based programs are going to start to start to start to start with the new collection of satellites, and we should start to start to start to start to start to start to start with the video-up of the video-up, and to start with the video-up of the video-up
It's the time. Thank you very beautiful.
There are many ways of how we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every family on the street so many of the things that they're not being arrested, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and interact with things like a pumble and cod and codels.
The projects came from my questions like how much money pay my neighbors?
How can we stop more things, without giving us a different?
How can we share our memories on the building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our own dreams for free houses so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My soul is sent by the giant fish that has been happy for hundreds of years, blind and shoury, and I'm afraid of a city where it's always in music.
I think every time you never heard, there's a pyst.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of them in America.
I live in this house and I started thinking how I could do it. And I thought I've been able to change something that changed my life for.
In 2009, I lost somebody who I loved.
She was the name of the name, and she was like a mother, and she looked at me. She suddenly looked and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and it made me the insight about things that are now important in life.
But it's hard to get this perspective every day.
It's easy to lose in the daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I started to get a page in a giant box, and I wrote a little bit of the lines of the lines, "I want to be gay, I want to take every piece of a piece of view of life and think about his own lives.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely closed and grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written by the people in the wall.
I'm going to be a lot of a sudden, I want to be more anti-food."
I'm going to be a lot of old, I want to stand on the International Project."
I want to sing for millions."
I want to be a tree."
I want to live the web."
I'm going to be hungry, I'd like to keep it in my poor."
I'm sorry, I want to be a guy's mine."
I'm sorry, I'd like to be myself."
This place was a meaningful place, and the dreams of people brought me to laugh, and I was terrified as the hard time I was.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to understand a new way and more and more.
It's about being a place for a place and thinking about what we're important to see, while we grow and change ourselves.
I did this last year, and I've got hundreds of great news messages that wanted to build their community, so my colleagues and I've been building a building and I've been building a building and now, like in Southeast Asia, South Asia, South Asia, and other walls.
We showed a lot of power in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have, time and relationships are different people.
In a world of extractions, it's important than ever before you look at things that are looking at the right and thinking that life is too short and uncomfortable.
We're often going to be out of being a death, or also to think about it, but I realized that the success of death is one of the things that are responsible to us.
The idea of death is that we have life.
Our common spaces are the best ones that we are as individuals and as a community, and more opportunities that we can share, our hopes and stories that can share us around us, not only to help us to help us to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to do with a very special problem for every one that's involved with the math, is that we're a business company.
No one knows what we actually do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dakes are one of the most human activity.
We're a look at the face of a bumble ball and the pets, like you're going to see.
The ball is a remarkable amount of potential and abilities, and perhaps a fundamental effect that could have a genetic number.
Sadly, neurosososos, like Parkinson's great ability. It's also in my sist, and it's also the way that he was in my sist, who was a ball of a ball-totot.
Over the years, you have a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 13 million people who are suffering in this disease, and they have to live with the unconcessable risk of the enemy, like the gay, and the other, the disease that causes that we need to identify, to discover the disease, to be too late.
We need to measure the progress of progress, and finally, the only way to know if there's a cure, if we have a rational effect that we can have the question.
In trouble, there's no other control of Parkinson's brain, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. So the best thing is, what's the next example of the 201-old neurosososos.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and it means that it's going to be published by clinical studies that never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a professional trip in the hospital. What if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't have a high-day hospital.
It costs 300 percent of the way that you can see in the neurologic field.
So I want to suggest you a non-term way of thinking about how to do that, because we're all of us, in some sense of the Solas.
Here's a video of the bright-like muscles.
This is what happens in the normal condition, if someone is a game, we can look at the same ball-like ball, because we need to use all these signals, if we're using the same, and we have all of the genes for the Google.
And like a ball, it requires a lot of work.
Think of how long a child needs to talk to you.
And by the same way, we can see the way that we can see the brain of the brain, and like the motor is also the ability of Parkinson's brain.
In the bottom line, you can see a number of extracellular feedback points.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Right, weakness, weaknessy, is.
The language is even more aggressive and more aggressive and more, and that's a example of it.
These effects can be autonomous, sometimes with digital micro-dimensional and analysis, with new computing learning, which is now, in the same way, where someone is a human, and it's just a little bit of a primate, and it's only a human disease of disease.
So how can these tests be using clinical trials? Well, they're not a non-furous. The test is the test of neurosologists.
It's too little. The infrastructure has been there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're all right. They're not going to be done by experts.
So you can be done in a way.
They're very fast, just 30 seconds.
They're very cheap and we know what that means.
If something very cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
And this amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce psychological difficulty for patients.
The patient doesn't have to do a long-term break of a hospital.
We can get a mathematical data from the most active results.
We can do the low-term development for clinical studies and first a study of the whole population is based on the whole.
We have the possibility of looking for the first time to look at the disease before it was too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we start to start the Parkinson's disease.
With a p-in-R. and the patient's car-R. We want to take a very high number of voices on the world to have enough data for the test.
We have a call of numbers that are three-year-old people on this planet.
Every one, or Parkinson's disease, can call a cost of cheap images for a few minutes. I'm talking to you about joy that we've already been talking about six percent of our target is already given by a fifth-term target.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we can take 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient's patient has to be told if this person is dying or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are in this, to find out what the actual signals are for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, your 25 percent of magnitude is the same?
It's much better.
My students -- I have to do it because he's done this amazing work -- now that it's also going to work over the mobile network that allows you to do with the project, and we're at 99 percent of the data.
I call that a function.
That means that people can -- people can call your phone and send people to the test. People can call Alzheimer's voice so that their doctor can predict their success.
That's right.
Thank you. Adam and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the east of the Northwest Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the back of the kitchen is the middle of the city.
The middle-state Park is just a very clear thing. That means that the wildlife animals can go to the park at the time.
The dolphins, the lions, they follow. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who died in night. I looked at the dead. It was terrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the European, believe that we came together with our animals and the Middle East of the sky. That means that we were so much of our animals.
As a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our enemy calls. They protect our tribe and our family. They're also taught for it because of that problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's a six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only a lot of lions in the supermarket.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years is responsible for his father. So it was so.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that that we wouldn't really help us see, but the lions who are going to see better.
But I didn't have a job. I did.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it with a bird's disease.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was going to go back to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they're going to see the bird's bird, and they go back, but they come back and they say, the thing that's not going to happen, that's still there.
And they're going to get out and kill our crops.
And one night, I started the p. I went up with a pour in the hand and I didn't get it around and then the lions didn't get the lions.
And lions fear light, that moves.
I had a idea.
And I was a little boy, I started working all the day in my room, and once I took the new radio, and I started to get my mother, and he took me almost as much about electronics.
I took a typical battery, and a brand of a motorcycle. The one shows if you want to go right or down the right.
And I got a switch to get the lights and to move the lights.
This is a small-in-in-in-in-in-mood box.
And then I started building all the way.
The solar transport is the battery that creates electricity to the quality. I call it a visual.
And the quality of the car is a little bit more bit more.
You can see that the flipples are coming out of the outside, because there are lions.
And so this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are flipping and the lions believe I went to the pore. And I was the whole time in bed.
Thank you.
I've been walking on home, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard of it.
One of them was the grandmother.
She had lost many of their animals and asked me if I could send their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I took the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since I've been in the neighborhood of seven houses with the lights and they've worked well.
My idea is used in Kenya, also as other primates, like hygiene and lions, and the lights are also used to be able to keep elephants from elephants.
My invention was a student of a university of the best schools in Kenya, and in Kenya, and I'm really excited.
My new school is working, and it helps to support and work on leadership.
I even took my friends home and we've been building the lights where there's no one, and I'm going to show people like you.
I just took a boy from the black woman who was beaten up his mother. I looked at the paper and said, "I'm going to sit in a box."
And here I'm here.
I had to put a plane for my first TED Talk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to go through lions. But I can save my father's birthday and the lions. We can live together, on the side of the lions, without argument.
Elizabeth<unk>n. In my language means that: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your listening.
So you have this drone. Yes.
You're working on other electricalization.
What's the next list?
My next invention, now, I work on a electrical spaceship. A autonomous app?
Yes, I know, autonomous radio is already invented, but I want to have my own own.
You've done it, you know, not true -- yeah, I've tried to try, but I've been able to try to get a little bit of time because I got a pot.
All right is hard. Richard Watson, you're kind of special.
We're going to be a step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you.
I've been old enough to get a camera in the hand, and my passion is, but today I want to share with you with 15-dimensional images, and no one I've done.
There was no kind of Internet, no idea, no chance to take a picture. Not even the air-through.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by the research of photography.
My story starts as I was in New York, and my wife was doing this picture that I put my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of the corner of the five and five.
At the same year, we were back in New York, and so we decided to let the same picture.
Well, you can see what's going on here -- right?
When the third birthday of my daughter said, "Hey, why don't you go to New York and do it, and they're a father's father's father's father to open the ritual?"
And then we started to ask a series of research, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal vision is when you're a completely stranger's camera.
No one has said no, and fortunately, nobody has never been touched with our camera.
At the time, we didn't even know how much of these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very unaware.
This is only a few weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened next day, so that a five-year can understand it.
These images are much more than a single moment, or a specific journey.
They are also a way for us to go back in June, and to change our time and how we change from a year, not just to understand ourselves, but in fact.
Because although we are always doing the same picture, the perspective of time, it changes new pieces, I can see the life with your eyes, how they're doing it and how they see it.
This is a very long time that we spend each other is something that we expect and expect every year.
In the last time of a travel, we went home, and suddenly they were constantly standing in the front of the way that they're looking at a red band on a text that they'd been learning as a little child, they'd been learning in the early class.
And she told me about their emotions that she had a five-year-old person at the moment.
She said that she was reminded her how her heart was taken from the chest when she saw nine years ago in the hospital.
And now they look at New York schools because they want to study in New York.
And I realized that, the most important thing we're all created is memories.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of creating a active role of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but by the 15 images, I'm not sure I'm a family photograph.
I'm always the one who makes the image.
I want to make every one of you today with a picture of being able to ask you and ask someone to ask someone, "Do you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
