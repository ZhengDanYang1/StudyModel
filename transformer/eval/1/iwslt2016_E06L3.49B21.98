When I was 11 years old, I was stuck by one morning from the sounds of the smelly joy.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was very angry the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone away!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obvious to my father, very happy.
"You can go to a right school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A right school.
The Taliban were doing the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
So I was so upsetting five years of a boy and I was a young sister who didn't have to take care of a secret school.
So we could go to school for both of them.
Every day, we took another way to make sure nobody could guess where we went.
We're hiding our books in a shopping store so it looked like we'd just buy a walk.
We were stuck in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a very nasty, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were suffering our lives: teachers, teachers and our parents.
And again, the classroom had to stop the class for a week because the Taliban had stopped.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop?
Did you know where we live?
We were afraid, but we didn't want to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and became more important and separated by daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign of a foreign of Afghanistan, and he was concerned about sending his daughter -- my mother -- and he was sent to school, and it was released by his father.
My mother, but my mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the workforce, just to turn our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my dad -- here -- this is the first thing in his family who ever received education.
And it was always clear that his children would get education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much greater risk of getting their children not to school.
I know that in the years, I sometimes was frustrated with the Taliban, and I was so frustrated by our life, and the silence of the conflict and the context of conflict.
I was happy to give a joke, but my father said, "Toy, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be thrown out of war from your house.
But one thing is that you're always going to stay alive: what's in there. And even if we need to pay our blood to pay for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give me a little more?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have a higher degree than the junior, and when my family didn't have been used so much for my education, I would be a woman.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proud, unfinished, gay, in the Middle Vagina College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was arrested by his family because he was told to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that was encouraged to express me.
He's not just talking to my high school, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one that goes through the car with Kabul.
My family believes me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
So I'm global ambassador for 10x0, one of the world's global campaign for education for women.
So I've been helping to build SOLA, the first and maybe the only public public public service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to look at their own convictions.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents, despite me, despite all the rest of the discourse.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of the city of SOLA in her village, and they're the death from a bomb from a bomb to just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone is shot, and he was a voice-daughtering him, and he was sending his daughter back to school, she would try to try again.
He said, "I'm going to leave you now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's talk because of your old, and unfinished ideas."
What I've discovered in Afghanistan is something that is often being reported in the West, that is, in the end of all of us, the success of the success of the success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's the fact that its success is.
That's not what our mothers don't want to play a really important role in our success.
In particular, they're often the people who are more sensitive and compelling to the very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men are not necessarily responsible for the men.
And under the Taliban, only hundreds of thousands of girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls are going to press school bank.
Afghanistan seems to look at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not about long-term and all the way to change the people's population.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them to encourage them, I see a very promising future and a self-interest for a long time.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unconventable possibilities, and remember the girls who go to the SOLA.
As I have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, even a life -- my life -- was represented by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm not -- -- I've -- I've got in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, and Somalia, working with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked on an Italian NGO, and every single project we gave on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought we're a good person in Italy, and we're good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which was my first book, "Ripples of the Zamhah, who was inspired, one where we wanted to show the people of Sambia, how to grow food.
We came to the Italian seed in South Korea, and we got to the Ki Chi Tower, which is what led to the Chiigrate River. We taught the local population of local wildlife and alcho and Pchini --
Of course, the local communities had absolutely no interest about it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make any of them, we said, "God is that we are here!"
"Bon time in time to save people from Sambia before the slime mold."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomato sauce. In Italy, they were so big, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato is closed and red, about 200 oilps came from the river and forth.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the pil!
And they said, "Yes, so we haven't got agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French community did, and after I saw what they did, I saw what they did, I was pretty proud about our project in Sambia.
We were doing the pilper at least.
They should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we didn't have any of the interconcepting African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid Aid" from Damasa Buroyo, she's a sub-mocian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent of Africa a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was made.
Just read their book.
read from a African-in-in-in-in-hiving, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, colonialists, colonialists, missional, and there are only two species of how we deal with people. We're cococators, or we're patriocic.
Both words come from the Latin root of "inch," which means "Vather."
But they have two different meanings.
Psychology: I'm going to keep myself myself in every other culture, as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm also going to keep myself myself in a different culture, as if they were my gay.
That's why white people are called "bise" head,
I was shocked when I read the book "Sally" "The Slickyyy" by Shie. He said, especially in the economic development of the organization, if people don't want to want help, they're going to let them go to calm.
That should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Today, Mr. Teszler who opened this conference, a bus on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocococic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I decided to write a system called a company called Business Production, where never gets a great one, never will be motivated, but you're going to be going to be a service of the local love, the local man who has a healthy dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you put together with a local,
We don't work from office.
We meet in cafes. We meet ourselves in Kobe.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to look at friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you do?
The passion for the individual growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing for humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can't be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of going to a community and say people, what do they want to do to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community collecters.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they never will say they're never going to be going to be going to be going to say what they want to do with their money, what they're going to see for the possibilities they want to see.
Design has this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to public meetings.
We work one to do this, and we need to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the house of the company, the house of the business worker who sits in your house, in your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to change your passion in a way that life is going to be able to change your life.
I tried this in the mess, West Recessions, trying to do that.
I was preparing time, and I tried to say the damaging of the damless, where we say others what to do, to escape.
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and I had my first three days of my first clients. I helped him. He had fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell him to a restaurant in a restaurant, and then they said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I've helped us help us help us help us?"
I helped work with these five fishs, and this wonderful tuna didn't sell to a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but after Japan, to the Sushi for 50, for 52, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, did you help them help us help us help them?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do -- I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I hear them."
So -- so the government says, "Let's try it again."
We did it in 300 communities around the world.
We helped 50,000 companies in the expedition.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to take loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers of history, died with 96 to 600 years ago.
Peter printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, "Take is actually unhealthy with a social society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christch, without knowing what the smartest human being-daughter of Christy with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to bring that to one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get distracted.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are talking about intelligence and passion?
For those of you who are most comfortable now tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, passionate people. They've been worried about this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to do.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- unhealthy fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The free-tiving style is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people to sustainable, build, build, transport and transport them with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who's going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Excuse me!
The government? Remember!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they do it now.
I read a wonderful story in a prehistoric magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of the city of New York City in 180,
In 180, they came together and they were replicated, and they were able to do what was going on in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a total: the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, when the population grows in this speed, they needed six million horses to get rid of people, and it would be impossible to be done with the crap of six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
and they look at the dirty technology that's going to kill life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive manufacturer in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had done the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearly, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing is to be offered to them is to be a mess.
They don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to offer them absolute, peaceful, passionate services.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest, the largest company has to be able to take all three things: that must be brand-to-power-power, the market needs to be great, and the financial debate must be huge.
Now, guess what?
We never met one person who can produce something simultaneously, sell, and they can take care of money.
That's not what's happening.
That person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 idiese companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wittway, Alexander, Ford, Google, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been known, just one: not only one person was founded.
Now we teach 18-year-old entrepreneurship, and we start teaching the class to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransonsica, and the task of the young student is to give up the first two sides of Richard Bransovica, how often he's using the word "the word "the word" and how often "the word "the word" is "the word."
Never "I" and 32 times."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who have a small pioneer, a local worker, sit in cafs and Barss. They sit. They are going to do their loved buddy, which is what someone's done for this gentleman who's talking about this guy talking about this subject. What's going to say?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't." "Do you feel someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We've been able to support groups of volunteers who are helping the companies to find them in their way to help them find the tools and people. We've found that the miracles of the intelligence of the local population is that the culture can change the economy and the economy, just by the passion, the passion and the energy of their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be, Alice's wonderful country.
And the Penn State University asked me -- a "Actor for communication -- peer-playing engineers in communication.
I was afraid.
The right fear. Fear about these students with their big brains and their large books and their big books and their great, not familiar words.
But as the conversations evolved, he took me like Alice when she was walking down to the electroton, and he saw a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students. I was amazed about the idea that they had, and they wanted to know that other miracles were found.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need really great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems that are our energy, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it's not going to be done. I believe it's not going to be in our responsibility as a political scientist to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't work when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you some ways of how you can do it, that we can see science and technology that you're busy with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, right?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Not just tell us that their parsles are studying, but they're also telling us that their pine muscles, the plastic structure in our bones, studying it because it's important to understand it, to understand the alopocosis and treat them.
And when you think that's what you do, you're going to have preventable dictionaries.
In the words, there's a obstacle to the idea of your mind.
I'm sure you could use it "ton" and time-time," but why not you just say "Rove" and time," what's much more comfortable for us?
So to make sense of the meaning of the mind, it's not the same thing that you can do to turn out the same level.
As Einstein said, "Tight things like this, but not simpler."
You can tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with tradeoffs.
So some things are to think about this: examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can take your hand into your mind.
And if you're going to put your work, then let's take the dots away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "Eject point?"
What happens when someone comes to mind? Another one is going to be taken, and with these dots, you know, your first favorite audience.
So a slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very hard to be in the conversation of the brain, and that's why we're quickly concerned about it.
So this example of Genemag Brown is much more powerful. She shows you that the special structure of the prosthetic body is so stable that it was actually the inspiration of the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence, just memory, where the audience is able to lose the thread, once it can lose the pieces, reuse images and graphs that are also refining our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us to open up these doors and see the miracles country that are going to be focused on science and technology.
And because the engineers I've been taught to teach me, who taught me to make the "Nerdin in my close contact, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
And look at your science and your translation, and you're looking at this, you're going to be able to share this through the "The Reception, so the audience tells you what's important, and it's the whole thing about the passion that you've done for your incredible work: and that's what you're doing is that you're doing with the most incredible interactions that are full of new things that are different.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm not really sure.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can print a cell phone, you can print a crime in the country in Syria.
You can start a phone message with a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on sound clip and be famous.
All this is possible with a cell phone.
I am in Berlin in 1994, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to change on the road and showed it.
We are in the fall of 1999, and we imagine that all these people who were coming out and asked to change, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who's got a cell phone phone in the room?
Just hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, hold them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost every one cell phone has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and my cell phone, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines of information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.R. has signed a legal line.
And this legal line is the law of the law enforcement.
And this is the right line that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service service, every Internet service, all the whole country, has to store a range of carriers.
Who calls who? Who's sending a email?
Who's sending a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All this information is being stored at least six months to two years from your phone companies or your Internet carriers.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up, and they said, "This is not what we want."
They said we don't want to use this criminal protection.
We want to call self-time, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, priests, who all said, "This is not what we want."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were being thrown out on the streets of Berlin, and they said, "Don't mean fear."
And some people even said this could be on Stya 2.0.
The Stino was the head-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-mathi in easternland.
And I'm also wondering if that really works.
Can all this information store on us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Deafel, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please send all the information that you've been carrying on me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer again. Just even blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing it.
So I decided to put a court process against them because I wanted to have this information.
But the Deafel said, no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was about a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to the discourse of what they all demanded me to do was to send the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of E.U.R. was a legal line in the German law.
So I got this ugly brown shift with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the defiance of the crime.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom out and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, try to track.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankurt to the train to K<unk>n<unk>, and how many calls I do on the road.
All this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just calling my wife and she calls me, and we're talking to a few times.
And then I'll call you a couple of friends and they call them each other.
And after a while, you call you and you call you, and we call you this huge network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how you can monitor a society, because you know who speaks to who is talking to someone who's talking to email, all that's possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said, at the beginning, we imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins had had had had cell phones in the winter of 1999,
And the Stino would have known who was at the demonstration, and when the Stora had known who was the leader, would it never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe not had happened.
And then, not the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today's national agency and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and fairly.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store all the time long.
But even self-determination and life in digital age is not contradiction.
But you have to fight the self-interest today.
They have to fight for every day.
So when you go home, you're telling your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say, you're just saying, "People, just because companies and national places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long long ago.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to get your information that they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you need to fight the self-assembly of the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: "Spise shops, rapid restaurants, refrigerate spaces.
So the city plan is taking a decision and they kept changing the name of South Central, so it's about something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spidering stores, rapid-time restaurants, skirts.
As two6, another American, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of Drive-in-inus and the Drive-muysa.
The magic is that the Driveieieieus is more people killed than the Driveys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from sacred diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is like five times higher than about a little bit of a delyly-shly-shirts, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even remember that.
And I wondered how you would feel like if you had no access to healthy food if you were going to live, every time you go out of the house, the negative effects of the energy system has the food system on your neighborhood.
I'm able to be bought to be able to buy the skirts and sell it like using the plant.
I see dialogue centers going down like Starbucks.
And I realized that this must stop.
I realized the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel more than about the short-minute, to get a apple that's not related to pesticide.
So I sold a food bar before my house.
It's a piece of land we call park plant.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in the state."
And I decided to hold it in the head.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, and we started doing this, and we started building my food, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a set of pre-creating group of people, together from all the social layers and all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else is concerned.
The city came to me and he basically came to me with a permanent highway, and he said I had to remove my garden, which was the equivalent of a fussing movement.
And I thought, "What's the real thing?
A great set of oil-making, because of food consumption, on a piece of land that doesn't matter you?"
And I thought, "Cool. HerM. Pug."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lope did a story about it, and talked to the city of Chicago, and they talked to a member of Green to Green Zero. They were doing a petition on Change.org, and we were successful with 900 rules.
We thought the victory was in the hands.
My town even called it, and said they're helping it and love it and love what we do.
So, really, why not they do that?
LA.S. has the most of the parking spaces in the United States.
They have 160 miles of gear in the wheel.
These are 20 Central Park.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why is it that the hell should not find it right?
And by growing the plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get a dollar of a dollar, and you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my "The Leadership," I'm telling people to grow their own food.
His own food is like to print their own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconcessive reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti. I'm going to put my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, the walls, I'm going to be able to break out lawns and park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my extraction for this stuff.
They're surprised what the Earth's soil can use when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine flower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as my garden was a instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
to change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would wonder how children are influenced by this.
The athletic are the most powerful and courageous act of the ability you can do, especially in the city.
And you can also get strawberels.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10:30 on night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason to go to the street."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that was just the one that's committed to me to do this. People said, "You're not afraid you're going to steal your food."
And I said, "No, no, no, I'm not afraid they're going to make it cool.
And that's what it's on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time I want you to take care of your health back."
And at another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in the R.A.
These are the guys who helped me to borrow the bar.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it's influenced, and how they were growing with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it's just for a moment.
Green Gries have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had these 50 people who came and they made it with it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon dioxide, kids eat jellyfish.
When they grow tomatoatoes, they eat tomato sauce.
But if they don't get any of those, if they don't get shown how to survive food and body and body, they eat, whatever you're going to be blind to them.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see color-sized kids who are exactly on the path that they were looking for, and they're not going to get anywhere else.
The chairs I see as a chance of learning where we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth's soil, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into healthy cafeteria.
So don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is that you have to stay in touch.
I'm talking about giving people work, and children from the streets, and they're going to give the joy to the pride and the honor of the honor of the privilege of working on their own food, and when you open the markets.
So what I want to do here is to make that sexy.
I want you to become all the ecological princess, gang, gang-touchers.
We need to turn the picture of the window.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gang.
If you were to get a shower, you know, yeah?
And let the gun of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you sit in the vars of the chairs and want to take a meeting where you talk about something, some pars.
If you want to meet me, you come up with your pangles, in my garden so we can plant some flaps.
Le peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the whole Oxford English dictionary is "nnollyogry."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nolly-inry" means "inventless politicians."
Despite a newspaper party in the 19th century, a better definition of an interview: "A Snolly Greyner is someone who is a foreign, independent, financial, or program, or publishing, and his success is going to be achieved by the pure power of the weak-regular algorithm."
I don't know what the memory is.
I think of it, I think, in other words.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers, not the exact word of the debate.
And that was actually going back to the man's man's man's man's man's personality with extraordinary names, Brillcazby, who was being brought to the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London and they threw him a hand, but he was courageous enough, he was courageous enough to stop, and eventually he had so much support in London he won't win.
And only a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "The Ride." Many believe.
And they're looking at the English word for the wheel.
But that's not true. It's going to be back to a government's press's press.
But to show you how words are interrupted and politics, I want to take you to the U.S. time when it's just done the independence.
You looked at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state, the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a foreign nation?
And that's been a very well-knownized in Congress.
And there were all kinds of computational suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Israel Washington, and others, his highness, George Washington, and again, the consumer of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
Not so much-in-mood.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought that's what they're doing.
They weren't monology, they wanted to choose the king to choose a certain time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this debate three weeks.
I read the days of a meeting that always writes, "I've been writing the same thing."
The reason for the slipping, and the short was that the front of the House was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington's work. They didn't want to do it.
King calls, and maybe they're going to give him ideas to their own.
They wanted to give him the most vulnerable, the most scary title, the most, the most scary title that they could find.
This title was "Pory."
President. They didn't invent the title. He was there. He was just meant that someone was running a series.
That's something like the pre-reood of a jury.
He didn't have any more size than the phrase "The Comcyclopedia" or "mast water."
Sometimes there was a handful of protesters and government groups, but it was really a unfinished title.
And so the Senate refused to give it out.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to be reprogressed and foreign-tooders.
Who's going to take it seriously when he's got a stupid little bit of letters like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't have been there.
Instead, we don't want to look at the word "Pothing" in front of the title, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they weren't agreed to be guilty of their most honest respect for the ideas of the ideas and civil society, whether it's in the Republic of Monarchy, where it's the director of the public, the state of the politics, the president, the president of the other people, the other people, the president, the other people
You can learn three interesting things about it.
One, and I think that's the best thing -- until now I haven't seen out whether the Senate has ever been awarded the Spanish title of President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- -- -- you wait to wait to 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States's name is "The End of America's United States is not so sharp, right?
And this has to do something more than 5,000 atomial fires that he has, and he has the largest economy of the world's economy and a baker drone drone and all this stuff.
And reality and history have given the title of size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They have a respectful title.
And the other worry about the principal, the misuse of self-destinity -- now, it was so.
But you know how many nations have a President?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear fires and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost, because nobody feels so humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States's United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'm going to leave you with.
We're trying to use politicians to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality of the words much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a train with about 50 orders of rebel on battle to battle to the Wriealalalabad -- a seven-year-old, vegetarian concert from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to make my black-told shoes against a pair of brown leather-in-in-taughters and a rocket in the way that I could never see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was born with war for a long time before, but after the Kjama party and football, and I was talking to Samburs and the rappings with the rained South-downed South-dictions and alliances, which never lived with the "Frenchingism" and worked with Afghanistan, and I was thinking that was what was going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing in a broken Afghan, Southeast, Southstag, Southstag, from God's Gagard, and a atheist, and a radical political artist who lived in a very political artist who worked in Afghanistan last nine years, and he's working on.
So, in Afghanistan, there are many great things you could do about art, but I'm personally not like to paint the rainwones. I want to make art that brings the personality and express authority and reporters and reporters the reality and the reality and even the kind of compelled people to try to understand the kind of collective peoples that we live in the world.
I want to spend a day in life of jihad -- "Gake that would be called his jihad against communists like "Popelel" and used to be able to use rape religious harassment and political corruption to help you to help.
And what else can make the jihad-thrade when the parliament had to pay for the parliament and put a choice campaign with the phrase: "Don't hire me! I do jihad, and I am rich."
And try to use this campaign to let these Makiosi to beat up the National Monei that's used to spend a national hero.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rove," where you take a police, a false control of the streets of Kabul and the cars, but instead of taking money money from them, and then give them money to the police, and the police of Kabul, and they hope that they're going to give us 100 of us a few of us to give us a chance of the Iraq.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan was being become the "Cultural War."
War and the alien views that came with him with a new environment for Style and fashion, which is only able to capture a fashion of a workshop for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put the pets of indigenous ghanchel with a local, or a bunch of different composty-tid-tid-tid-tid-tid-touching.
And I'd like to see how a simple slipper from Kabul looks like a simple slipple from 12th-century app to create a dialogue about this, that today's current development of all the development institutions in the last developed, in the entire, the Sistine Curiation of Syrs, and maybe have a brown man to protect it and even even to protect it to protect it to a lot of civic and even protect it.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, miswood.
But I do it because I have to do it because I need to have to have the geography of self.
That's my burden. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly right.
I feel that now, in the room, there's a kind of a unfinished tension, because I didn't want to wear this clothes.
Fortunately, I've got something to change with it.
This is the first time someone's in the TED stage, so you can be happy to see that I think.
If a few women were really upsetting when I came out, you don't need me to say this now that I read on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
And that's not the chance to do that.
These pressures are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the flush over my head, because you're all going to stop me, so you're not doing anything until it's about my head.
All right.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it was not that embarrassing as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but it's a picture of a very roughness.
I've changed your mind in six seconds.
And this picture -- I've never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrongest flues that I've been trying to get to work for two days ago, there's very few ways to change our vocabulary, and our name has a very little bit of "The" -- despite the dark and unregulating, it's a huge impact on our lives.
I'm afraid to be honest to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a beautiful white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "What's the model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was an model is a profit in the genetic lottery, and maybe a great legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we haven't just defined beauty as healthy and young and beautiful and symmetrical, in the revelation of wonder, we're biologically programmed, but also as big, courageous, rap, rap, white and bright leaders.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners like, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra, yor. Hey, Mr.B. Hes. Who is Bu."
And I'm going to talk about your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that all have signed up on the backside, every single one that was thrown out, and that was only 7007,000 pieces of wood, only less than four percent of them were not white.
The next question that I'm always asked to myself is, "Can I become an model when I am grown up?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the U.S. or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-in-in-in-in-in-law, which would be absolutely wrong, because you're the first."
When they say, "No, no, I want to become a model," I said, "Who's going to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for it, and you could be the editor of American bird, or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M;M, or the next Steven Meis.
And say, you want to be a model later, like, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to have to get a model later, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to have to have to have to have a look at the guy that you want to get a little bit like, you want to get to get
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of research, because it's different than heart surgery, it can only be expanding now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is exactly there, like a nice tube, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to go to a picture of the room," now the leg goes up, and so long, this arm goes back to the back, and you're going to move back, and you just take three-dimensional, and you just look back and you see, you see, you know, you know, four minutes, you know,
It looks like this.
Hopefully less weird than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happening.
If you finished school, and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say a lot more, unfortunately, if you want to say that you want to be President's going to be the U.S., but you're going to be in life expectancy, you're going to look at 10 years of rice, you're going to look at weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who's all the photos?"
And yes, so all the photos are being cut, but this is just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photograph I did, and that was the first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
I'm this guy's day of the clock.
My girlfriend had to join me.
I'm on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shinting for the French bird.
I'm here with the football team and the C-thon.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see these pictures are not images of mine.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Haigylene, and the emailers and photographers and Penylologists and all their guests and their guests and the evaluation. They're not. I'm not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Who are you doing things for free?"
Yeah, I've got a lot of 20-c-tail shoes that I never can wear, except the things I'm going to get free is things I get to get to get in real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you had the clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she went over and she was a red light, and of course we were stopped. And of course, it took a "Excuse me, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, and we could go on.
I've got these unsolerable things because of my appearance, and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their appearance and not pay attention to their personality price.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and filtered over 85 percent of black and Latino and mostly young men.
It's living in New York only 177 young, black men and Latino, for which they're not asking the question, "Who am I listening?"
But I said, "How often am I going to stop? When am I going to stop?"
And I found out that talk that 53 percent of the last year-old girls in the U.S. were not like their body, and this number goes up to 78 percent when they've become 17.
The last question to me is, "What is it to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and bright hair, you feel very happy and wonderful."
And we give a answer that might be given to this idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great to work with creative, passionate, passionate, passionate, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before, what I never said before, is, "I feel not sure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I feel happier when I had a little bit of black legs and a black hair?"
And then you should meet some models, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest flipples, and they're the same because of their appearance, probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to take me a more difficult, because I felt very uncomfortable with this, and I felt very uncomfortable to go to this, and I said, "I got all the benefits that were all of the pieces that were brought into my water." And it's not very good to make me feel good. And that's not always makes me happy."
It was very difficult to open up a legacy of despair against gender and race when I'm one of the greatest uses of it.
But I'm happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this before 10 or 20 or 20 years ago, and my career was still unfinished, because I would not say how I was going to tell my first job, or maybe I would not be married, I would not be married, like I was so good at college.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our instincts and error.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to the ex-excess of life: "Son, pafi's heart attack.
But I'm not going to be something like a Gafafi revolution."
It's already been taken by almost two years since the Dutch revolution, inspired by the waves of mass destruction and all the stuff in the Egyptian revolution.
I was all about a lot of other leyers, and outside and outside of the way, trying to challenge a day of anger and start a revolution against the tyranny regime of Gudadad.
And it was there, a great revolution.
Boy, boy, women and men were in the first row, the end of the regime, the Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've been proved by the most compelling courage to get on the violent dictator of Gaddafafaf.
They've shown a very strong sense of liquidity, from the far east above the far east, until the South.
Finally, after a period of dry war, and almost 50,000 dead, it took us to liberate our country and the tyranny.
But Gafafi has left a big home, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation of the process.
Over four decades, Gafafis's regime has destroyed the infrastructure and the culture, and the moral structure of the pink-in society.
The destruction and the challenges, I said, how many other women are building civil society of Lyas, and we asked to have a composted and a reintroduced transition to democracy and national collapse.
In fact, 90 organizations were being launched right now and immediately after Naddafis in Benghaz, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years, I came back to Lyopsia, and I started working with a unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize the issues of the task, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace-in-law of Ley Meny women, a movement of women, leadership, leaders, their goal is to be to be able to consider public-speaking, to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be honest for women's rights and peace-making and peace-making.
And I met a very hard environment in the election, a community that was more and more powerful, a environment that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and of dominance.
I was a campaign to bring peace-incessive women to get a legal license, a law, no matter what citizens should choose to choose to vote with the right, and to decide for all of the demand and to have a political relationship between a political man and a male-level relationship between a green-level platform and a turn-up platform to make a difference.
At the end of our initiative, our initiative was taken over and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation-state elections in the first elections since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphic of elections, and the whole revolution was about "The whole revolution," because every day we were thinking about new news about violence.
So we went to the front of the re-through-through-towning of ancient mosques and the Sufi lines.
On another morning, we got news about the murder of American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And again, another morning, the suicide bombers were given by the Army's Army.
And in fact, every day, we were under the governing of the governor and their ongoing conflict against the human rights, and their failures of rules and laws.
Our society, created by a revolutionary mind-based self-sath, polarized, and moved from the ideals of the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, the way they were looking at it.
Strowing, misuse, and the cursors were turned to the icon of the "Fol Age" of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you to inspire the success of our discourse and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to admit that we were as a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong decisions that we've met.
We made our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace and security in Lyia.
Did the re-excession and the change between women and men's rights and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is our society going to be expanding and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and mastery and men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only one who missed the only thing, but the female values of compassion, the Gard, the Gade and the purpose.
Our society needs a national dialogue and attitude to the elections as it needed to be the end of the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the more vulnerableity of women than they need the experimental, more powerful, more powerful, female.
We need to stop the name of anger and ask one day to demand the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gardard.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just accept the next values, but also to be honest: "Satless instead of a rable, or collaboration instead of competition, rather than reuse competition, rather than being reuse.
These are the ideals that need one of the cold-towing Lyyia to get peace.
Because the peace has a alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the reception of the feminist and the pony of the pets.
That's the real-sensitive.
And we need to do this in a way before we do it, we need to do it in sociologically.
After a call from the Koran "Salam" -- peace, "I'm the word of the Good God, hainy."
The word "rave" again, which is known in all the back-raagagham traditions, has the same Arabic, like the word "The Purra," "My mother's mouth, and symbolically, the matrine, the family of humanity, the man's lives, the male and the female, all the peoples were all over.
And just like the mother's blood in the embryo that grows in it, all the way that's going to be so much the rest of compassion's nature's most of the existence.
And so we said, "My Gard, all the things are all about."
And so we said, "My Gardard had been in front of my "The Sum."
Let's take all the stuff that we're going to be paid to do.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're talking about the story of Kim Il, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until I was living on a whole change time.
And I was watching a public processing, and I thought, "I was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And it said, "If you're going to get this up here, our five family members will not be more than this, because we've been eaten for two weeks.
We are connected to the ground and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were suffering in my country.
In short, I went over to the train, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete myself anymore from my memory.
A poor woman was on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was shaking in his arm, and he was shaking his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all busy doing this, to care about their families.
In the mid-'9s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North America's famine colonies were like to sacrifice, and many more people had ever been, because they ate grass, and they ate the beetle and the treeline.
The electricity waste is often worse, so at night, it's all going to be so smoothly, except the lights of China on the other side of the fish that we stayed in.
I was always wondering why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Airm, and the part of the river as the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very scary, and it allows Northstans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies moving down the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was being sent to the devastating, the death of the famine, I was sent to the distance of the country to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated to my family for a short time.
I never thought it needs 14 years to be able to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as a Northstan refugees. But soon I was soon learned that it's not just very difficult, but also, Northma refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back into a terrible fate to North Korea.
One day, my biggest Alptard room was true when I was trapped from the Chinese police and sent into the police department.
Somebody was told me to be Northan-an-law, so they tested my Chinese records, and they asked me many more questions.
I was so afraid of that, I thought my heart would explode.
So dignity seems to be something irrational, I could be trapped in a broken and unfinished.
I thought that's the end of my life, but I did it to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they were done with the questions, a leader said to the other, "This was a false deal.
It's not Northan-in-in-in-in-in-in."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Northanans, he's going to take account in China's foreign messages calledyl, but many of them are caught by Chinese police and showed up.
These girls had great fortune.
Although they were caught, they finally were released by massive international pressures.
These Northstans didn't have so much fortune.
Every year, there are numerous Northmaans in China, and they're being rejected after North Korea, where they're being replicated, they're being locked up in public or they're being replicated.
Although I was lucky with my own, it's not so much of the Northmaans.
It's tragic that Northanans hide their identity and have to struggle hard for survival.
And after they learned a new language, and they found work, their world can be put on a moment on the head.
After 10 years of memory, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was able to let me go to South Korea, a bigger challenge, when I thought I had thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've noticed the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside inside, we've been very close to the inside of the inside, because of 42 years, of the part.
I was running through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northan-an-Amor?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the obsession of the southern Asian life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the introduction of the university.
Just as I was treated myself in my new life, I got a scary call.
The Northstan authorities started the money that I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible as possible as possible, so I started planning their escape.
Northanans have to take a incredible route back to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me back to the way to the Northstan border.
Because my family didn't talk Chinese, I had to drive it, and I had to bring them to more than 2,000 miles through China, and then after South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we got almost twice.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the exact idea of all of this, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese warrior, my family said, I was accepted, and he said, "You know, she was a little bit embarrassed, and I was a seminar.
He looked at me crazy, but fortunately he believed me.
We managed to take it to the o-Cat border, but I had to use almost all my money to go and to the border of Lobya's border.
But even after we had been traveling the border, my family was replicated, because of illegal border.
After I paid money sentence and married, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was replicated, the capital of Las.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to interrupt my family to freedom, and we were so close to my family, but my family was arrested, just before the southern Kelanan's message.
I went out and forth between the immigrants and the police department, and I was trying to clean my family, but I had no enough money to pay money to pay money or money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man was like, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without a police, he went to a bank, and paid the money for my family and two other Northmaans to get them out of jail.
I was telling him about all of my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said, "I'm not going to help you."
"I'm going to help the Northstan Indians."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger who had a new hope for me who needed the Northanans, who was so desperately so hard, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope to need the world's most profound, the Northanans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I was moving together in South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many North America are separated from their families, and as soon as they come into a new country, they start doing something with no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, the English, the education education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us are still stuck in contact with family support, and we send them information and money to change the water that helps to change North Korea.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to be more passionate about the most hopeful Northstans of success, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North America in the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Si is 22, big and very good sight.
He can't talk, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not be heard.
Si knows what love is.
He's not going to share it, and he's going to share it unfinished.
It's not bad. He doesn't stop the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and she's just wondering, "He's never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's not even trying to remember the words that I remember, he reminds me about one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown you need to be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good at his eyes.
He has absolutely a real sense of memory.
But he's got a selective one.
He can't remember if he's stolen my chocolate, but he remembers the paper of every song from every song on my iPod, who we had four conversations, while he was four months after the first result of the teagaget on my arm and her arm, Gagas.
Don't they hear incredibly?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they're often being understood and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged me and my soul was that despite the case, despite the case, despite the case, despite the fact that they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean was extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term-controlledism," it's a complex psychiatric disorder of the brain, the social communication, the learning, the learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's different in every single individual, and it's like Si is so different than Sam.
And the world is estimated every 20 minutes of autism in a new person, and even though it's one of the fastest growing development of the world's population, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember myself without any day.
I was just born three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized he was different.
He was very, very much.
He didn't want to play the same babies, and he actually didn't seem to be very interested in me.
Si lived and defeated in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of joy, like cars, to put cars into a series of space, to eat the washing machine and eat everything that came from it.
And as he grew older, he became different, and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the Frony and the never endbeat hyperactivity was something that was a really unique: a completely innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being never had.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there was some challenging moments in my family, moments, moments I wish they were just like me.
But I go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about, about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I would not want to trade against normalness.
So the normality of beauty that we give us the differences, and the fact that we are different, is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of thing.
And if I could just tell you one thing about ii, and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift. And in all of us, the pursuit of the normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change dies in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else's life.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edon has been filled with awe and curiosity, with this picture, with a little apple through a shark and with a mass of a half-hour period of magnitude.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a million, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto- photographer, a new design technology that's so fast that it can build the slow-time-time-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-scapse of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at the outside of our perspective or not a <unk>-ray image in our body and can look in a really question about what we're doing with "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser scan and I take it into a billionth- second- second-by- second-by- second-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by
So, if you take this project, this photons of photons, and you take it into that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the light in slow motion?
So this event -- this event.
So think about this, this is actually a very much more event than a nanotot, so long, the light needs to take that route -- but I've been trying to get this video to do this video to see 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what's happening.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle of a photons that starts moving through the inside and then melt the inside.
And a part of the light is turning out on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately going to reach the flow of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's floating around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table, and because of the reflection of the sound, you see that the reflection of the fly is focused on some of the images.
Now, if you take a common project, and you take it back and you can slow it back the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you need to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And how about something else-time photography?
You can see the waves of the table that's going to wash Tomel and the wall over the back.
It's like you put a stone into a pond.
And it seemed like the nature would paint this picture, every single-to-screen, but of course, our eye looks a mixed image.
But if you look at this Tom's Day again, you'll see that when the light comes out of the Tom's light, that's going to keep that further, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's Day is coming up and the light goes around in her and back to a few-dimensional seconds.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera in your camera is built in your camera, it could be possible to go to a supermarket, and you can find out if a fruit is a fruit, no one's going to touch it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, when you do a picture of a short-time period, you have very little light, but we have a bold one billion times faster than your shortest time, so you get something like nothing else.
So what we do is we send this project, this photons, this photons, a million-foot-tix, and we draw it again and then we're doing it again with very clever synchronization, and we're doing this gigabytes of data, to make this piece of data, to make this Ptox video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future super-power: can you see the lines?
The idea is that we're going to put something on the door.
It's going to go into the room, and it's going to be a part of it, and it's going to be going to be going to be reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these more nuanced, more than the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
And behind the wall, a soup is hidden, and we're going to let the light down on the door.
After our paper, the Interformicce Organization was published, it was released by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to break this light project and we're going to put it on this wall and put it on this wall and put it into the photons of the cameras and then some of the photons are going to be taken into our hidden soup, and then again, the light will break the light, and then then then the one of the lights will turn back a tiny bit of light, and then they're going to come back to the tiny bit closer to the camera,
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto- camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-effective, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the objects that are all over the hidden objects, but we don't know what's going on with the point of distance.
By adding a laser, we can take a plastic image that looks like -- how they look at the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and they try to fill together, and try to analyze the different light-through light, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our design process.
We've got a little bit to do this before we could do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars, we could detect the collisions, and we can see what's behind the curve, or we can look for them in dangerous mens, by looking at light by looking at light, we can see the window, or we can build the open wall, or we can see the open wall around the body, and the glass of the glass, and the glass,
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, why this is a rollup for scientists, now thinking about Ftototo-D-mur photography, because a new animation process could actually solve the next generation of medicalization.
So, like Doc Edon, a few seconds, even a scientist, the science has become a art of the ultra-tale photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we collect every time we collect, not only the scientific processing process, we can create a new computer layer of time, and we can't just look at the wave of light, and we can just look at all of these things, and we can're not look at the time
But it's something weird about this.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should be to move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've seen almost in light effects, weird effects, and Einstein had seen this picture incredibly.
The sequence of events in the world are happening in the camera, in the back-up order, so by using the relationship between space and time, we can correct that bias.
So no matter whether it's possible for photography or focus around a new visual control of medicine or new design, or new interfaces, since our invention, we've been making all the data and details on our website, and hope that the Makerers, the team, we should be able to show us that we should start to start the creative and we want to start to start the latest dimension of the video and the video-dimensional graph -- and we should start to start to start to
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbor on the road so many of the things that they don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
I tried to share more with my neighbors over the last few years, and use things like a little bit like a stick, and then use the pets and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much money are they paying my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without keeping ourselves apart?
How can we share our memories of the buildings that we're going to share and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being disrupted by the giant light that's been so many hours of loved, drunk and criss and crissles. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never never ever missed, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the rests of the people in America.
I live in the room near this house, and I thought about how to make it feel, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very.
She was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came out and unexpectedly.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life's lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the house into a giantboard, and I wrote with a scisslele on the gaps, "I want to die, I want to say, I want to take every one piece of chalk, you can think about your own life and your hopes to share this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and she grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people in the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be worried about piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on the International Recime Pass."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live "bat."
"I'm going to die, I'd like to keep her in my poor."
"I'm going to die, I want to be somebody's Kavallid."
"I'm going to die, I'm going to be completely myself."
And this was a very compelling place, and the hopes and dreams of the people, and the people, they brought me to laugh, the wine and the shook me as hard as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding it in a new way and more comfortable.
It's about creating space for participation and thinking and remember what's most important, while we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of conversations from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I created a buildingboxbox, and now we've been building a buildingbox in the world like Kazanan, South Africa, South Africa, Australia, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to connect our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of extractions, it's important than ever before, looking at the things that are looking at the right and think about that life is short and sensitive.
We're often going to talk about death or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that's most protected us.
The idea of death is what makes us life.
Our common spaces show us what we are as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, and with more of our hopes, our hopes, our stories, our stories, can share people around us, can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm working on math. I'm a special problem for anyone who's working on with high-tested math is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to try to explain you what I do.
Dove is one of the most human activity.
We are looking at the same thing from the front of the deer and the pets and the ropes, as you're going to see.
For example, a very remarkable amount of knowledge and abilities and abilities, and perhaps a fundamental signal that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It's also doing it in my pre-down Janop, which was a ballet of surgery.
Over the years, they've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to have to be suffering with the unconable symptoms of how weaknesses, bissess, pies, and other people who live, which is why we need this disease to discover objective disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the advances objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is cure, if we have an objective scale, that's a question.
In trouble, it's not that there's no biomarkation and other movements of Parkinson's blood disorders, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing you have is this 201-minute test to neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical studies, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a pre-daughter in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't require the private hospital.
It's cost 300 percent to study the neurologic zone.
So I'm going to tell you a non-conventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all in a certain sense, virtual synonymous like my name, Janricap.
Here's a video of the vibrating sounds of the sound.
That's what happens in the healthy state when someone's writing a speech. We can look at our own ballets, because we need to coordinate all these devices, if we're building clay, and we've all got the genes for FoxPaw.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it until it's learning.
And by looking at the activity of the dopamine, we can determine the brain of the dopamine, and as the receiver is also affected by the muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the bottom line, and you can see an example of a basic sound-sensitive memory.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Right, weakness, weakness, weaknessess.
The language is even more aggressive and povered, and this is an example of psychic.
And this impacts can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and individual analysis, and in effect, with new machine learning, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now find out where someone is in a carax between disease and health, just because of the sounds.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test with neurologists.
It's so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are exactly exactly the same. They're not going to be done with the action of experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a very high scale.
And this amazing goals can be able to do this now.
We can reduce cognitive difficulty for patients.
patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can reach objective data through the most sophisticated observation.
We can do low-cost massization studies for clinical studies, and we're going to be able to make a research in the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're doing the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease-in-service.
With Acat and patient's Day, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough vehicles to provide the extra dimensions for the next step of this goals.
We have a reputation number that is available to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Each, without Parkinson's disease, can call cheaply to leave pictures for a few cents. I'm talking to you guys about joy, that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we say 10,000 people, you can say, "You can say who is healthy and who is not?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the call has to be told when this person is suffering or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to make it at the end.
But we collect a huge database of different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are to turn that into the order to find out which is the actual markers of Parkinson's disease.
At the time, your 86 percent accuracy has been done?
It's much better.
My students -- I have to blame him because he's done this amazing work -- now, it's now shown that it's working on the mobile phone network, which allows this project to allow you to be 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a more improvement.
That means that people can call -- people who can call the phone phone and they use the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, put their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
That's right.
Thank you very much. Max Baby, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern Rand of the Nairobi National Park.
And in the background, you see the cows of my father and that behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like the wild animals that can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found her dead. It was horrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Farland of the sky, and so that's why our animals are so much.
I was learning lions in the same time.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our mouths. They are also compelled to this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is between six and nine years responsible for the cows of his father. That's how I did.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't do it. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to take it on a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to go next to the cow's.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird's. They go back again. But they come back, and they come, and they say, the thing is not going to move, that's still there.
And they take a look at it, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I went around with a puble around the hand and then the lions didn't get rid of the lions.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working on the whole day in my room, and I once took the new radio of my mother, and one day, she was almost about me. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old carrier, and a legal drive from a motorcycle. This shows you whether you want to turn up on the right or on the left. It's a light.
And I turned a switch to turn the lights up and turn it down.
This is a little black lamp from a broken glass lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar bubble is making the battery that's causing electricity to the right-informance. I call it a propulsion.
And the right-being is a little bit more noisy.
You see that the leaves are looking at the opposite, because they come from there because the lions come from.
And this is what this looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are shining and the lions believe I'm going to go around the edge. And that's the whole time I was in bed.
Thank you.
I was running this on home with us, and since we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped this.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. They can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been spending seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in all sorts of birds, including hygiene or leopard seals, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from flowering.
My invention helped me give a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it's helping to help people do this with donations and education.
I even put my friends home and we collect the lights there, where there's no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I was just a boy from the savanna who was crying his dads. I saw airplanes about me, and said, "I'm going to sit in a sit."
And here I am here.
I was able to visualize a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to hide lions. But I can save the cows of my father's own father and the lions. We can all be able to live together, side, with the lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you hear.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list?
My next invention, now I work on a electric fence. A prosthetic electrode?
Yeah, I know electrical pars are invented long ago, but I want to have my own own.
You've been trying to do it before, not right -- yeah, I've tried to try, but I've been able to give you a look back to the time, because I got a stick.
All the beginning is hard. Richard Turder, you're pretty special.
We're going to hire you to feed you on every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and no one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture, no one was even considered the lighting.
To be honest, most of the people have been shot from random tours.
My story starts when I was a talk to New York, and my wife made this picture, where I gave my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 and five.
So, in New York, we were later, and so we decided to take the same picture once.
Well, you can see where this is going on ...
When my third birthday came closer to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you want to go to Sabina to New York and do it a father-law to lead the rituals?"
And then we started asking, we started asking the work-towning tour, a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're a complete stranger, you know, you know, it's a completely depressed camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody is not even sitting with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travels would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a shot moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way to keep a way in October of the day and to keep the time and change our time and how we change our year from year to become not just physical but in everything, in everything.
Because while we do the same picture, our perspective changes from time. As they're always reached new pieces of pieces, I can see the life with their eyes, as they deal with everything, and how it looks.
And this very intense time we spend something we're expecting, and we're expecting to estimate each year.
And so recently, while one of our travels, we went to a walk, and suddenly they stayed like they were standing up like they were, they show up on a red bar on a plate of a plate, which was a little kid who had learned to love to learn to travel in earlier days.
And she told me about her feelings that she had in the same place as five-year-old,
She said she remembers her heart of her chest when she saw nine years ago the shop store for the first time.
And now they look at it in New York schools because they're really supposed to be able to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all build is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious form of memories.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides this 15 pictures, I'm not very little at a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage you to come to the picture today and not ask someone to ask you, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
