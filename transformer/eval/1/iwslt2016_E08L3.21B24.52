When I was 11 years old, I was stumbling by one morning of the sounds of the blind joy.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show of the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at that time, because it was mostly depressing the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were using the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was so upset by five years of being a boy and I was committing my older sister who had not been allowed to go to a secret school.
It's only the way we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to guess where we were going.
We're going to put our books in shopping so it's like we'd just go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a bit more stiffy, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risked by our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and over and over again, the class had to be rejected for a week because the Taliban had once been blind.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they going to stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we didn't want to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign man from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he was about sending his daughter -- my mother -- and she was sent to school, and he was convicted of his father.
But my educated mother, but she became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, only to turn our house into school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family who'd ever gotten a school.
And it was always obvious that his children would get education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much larger risk of sending his children to school.
I still know that in the years, I was so frustrated by the Taliban, and I was so frustrated by our lives, and the constant fear and the interruption.
I was very good to give up. But my father said, "Toy, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced from your house.
But one thing you're going to stay forever: what's inside here, and even if we have to pay our blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give back to that?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have a higher degree than the junior degree, and when my family didn't have been so much engaged for my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proud unconventor of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was ripped away from his family because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who shared me.
He's not just crying with my college degree, but also that I was the first woman and I was the first woman who runs him through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x1, a global campaign for education for women.
So I've helped to build SOLA, the first and maybe the only public public public service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school students are still still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to perceive all of them with great ambition.
And to see how their parents and fathers stand for them, as my parents, despite all the time, and according to the discouraging conflict.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed's father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she's death from a bomb on the street just to escape a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rings, and he's wearing a voice, and he's going to kill him if he sent his daughter to school, she'd try it again.
He said, "You know, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game for your old and over-towned ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've found something that often gets out of the West: the back of most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is aware that their success is also its success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't really matter in our success.
They're often the ones that are highly accurate and critically compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men.
Seven hundred girls in the Taliban went to school, because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are beating the school bank.
Afghanistan appears from America, and it's different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long from the long duration and changing the state of the U.S. communities.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, the hope and the unlimited possibilities, and remember the girl coming to the SOLA.
Just as I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to work on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years ago, thought that we are a brilliant human being and we were very good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book of the Zambehhenzi, was one where we wanted to show people of Sambans, how to grow food.
We came up with Italian seed in South Korea, and we got to the Kathi Chord Mountain, and we trained the local-state Asian tomato and Abchini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest of it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such waste of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God, we're here!"
"Fake time in time to save people from the Sambias in front of the slime."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-viic tomatoatoes. In Italy, they were so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the rabamb, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato boom and red were black, about 200 niffers came from the river and forth.
We said to the Samben, "Oh God, the mailier!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great at Italy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English people did, what the French, after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the mortal worm.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have not been defending the intergressional African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid" by Damham Moyo, she's a cross-terroristististist.
The book was published in 2009,
We have given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was.
Just read her book.
Check out of an African-Americans, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, imperialists, colonialists, mission zones, and there are only two species of how we deal with people. We are codronists, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root, which is "Vater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchic: I treat each other in another culture, as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronicis: I treat every other culture, as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bight," CEO.
I was stumbling when I read the book "Small's Beautiful" by Schumble. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, let them go to quiet.
That should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
Now, the gentleman who opened this conference, a bus on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolic?
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I invented a system called corporate management, where never gets started, never being motivated, but you will be a service of local passion, the local man who has the dream, have a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you put yourself with the local community.
We're not working from offices.
We meet in cafs. We meet in Kneipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this person, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We help them find knowledge because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of going to a community and saying to people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
entrepreneurs never have been part of them, and they'll never be told to be public, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
Designing this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community are not known because they never appear to public meetings.
We're working one to do this, we've got to be able to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the hospital of the company, the hospital of the business, who you're sitting in your house with your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way to change life.
I tried this in vitigity, West Depares, trying to do that.
I was trained to the time, and I tried to escape the abading fluffs, where we say to others what to do.
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, I had my first clients. I helped him to get a garage, and he was Maori, and I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then they came to the fishermen and they said, "You know, "You know, you can help us help us?"
I helped these five fish farmers work together and they don't help them to sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany to 60 cents to Japan for the S<unk>5050 dollars for S<unk>KK, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them help them?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do ... I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's try it again."
We've made it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 50,000,000 companies in the platform.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be interfered by loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter Cochrane was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, planning is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch around without knowing what the smartest man Christelel's best friend of her money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this one to get to one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
For those of you who are most cheerably cheated this morning?
"Tallful, passionate people. You've lied about this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- defensable fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The power engine is not sustainable.
The free art of the defiance is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways to cure, build and transport them with addicts.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Do you forget universities?
The government? Forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a great story in a monarchy many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in 18600.
In 180, they came together and they were using modular, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a total: New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, when the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get paid, and it would be impossible to get rid of the dung from six million horses.
Because they went in the dung.
and they look at the dirty technology that's going to feed the life of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the backland.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered by discourse.
Otherwise, they're not coming and they're talking to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate services.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, you've got to be able to take all three things: selling product, you have to be grandmect, and you have to be a great deal with financial publishing.
So guess what?
We've never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and can care about money.
That's not something that exists.
This person never was born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 ivory companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wudhouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been known, only one: no one was founded by only one person.
Now we teach 17-year-old entrepreneurship in North Carolina, and we start teaching students to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransonsons Autobiography, and the task of the 17 year-old student is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransovica, as often as the word "tich" and as the word "w" is, and as often as the word "we" as well.
Never "ich" and 32 times "we."
He was not alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who have a small entrepreneur, sit in cafeteria and Bars and Bars, and they're going to do what someone in this gentleman has done for this gentleman talking about this subject. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you think I'm going to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the corporate facilitators to try to find the tools and people. We found out that the wonders of the local citizens are making the culture and the economy of this community can change only by engaging the passion and energy and imagination of people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be to be Alice in the miracle country.
Penn State University asked me -- a CEO of communication -- to encourage engineers to communicate.
I was afraid of it.
Real fear. Fear for these students with their large brains and their large books and their large books, not trusted words.
But as the conversation evolved, he turned me like Alice when she was driving down the organ, and he saw a door to a new world.
I just felt like when I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the idea they had and wanted others to discover this miracle country.
I think to open up these door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the ones that are taking our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it's not going to be progressable. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-human scientist to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles in their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
Let me show you a couple of ways of how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're engaged with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to us is, well?
Let's tell you why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Not only to tell us that their grandfathers are looking at their own grandchildren, but also tell us that their grandfathers, the plastic structure in our bones, because they are important to understand alopocoseosis and treat them.
And when you describe what you do, then you're going to be preventable.
Scient-speaking is a obstacle to understand your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "ton" and time," but why don't you just say "t you" space and time," which is much more consciously for us?
So to make sense of meaning, it's not the same as you're going to turn down the level.
As Einstein said, "Tight things are as easy as possible, but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with compromise.
Some things are in terms of taking care of this: examples, examples, stories and analogies. So you can pull us into your mind.
And if you present your work, then let's take the dots away.
Have you ever asked yourself why it's called "Ejectface"?
What happens when someone comes to mind? Another one is going to be weeks, and with these dots, your first audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also makes you very much more interested in the work of our brain, and it's very quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the particular structure of the prosthetic limb is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffelelel.
The trick here is to use a single, easy, easy-to-the-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-face, where the audience can lose the sign, and then use images and graphics that also inform our other senses, and it creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up these door and see the wonderland that are going to be told by science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, taught me to make the "Nerdin in me" tightly tightly, I want to summarize everything with an equation.
So look at your science and your translation and your writing, and so the audience says what's important, and multiply the passion that you've got for your incredible work: and that's what you're going to do with your incredible interaction that you're going to do with.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm very interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a drone with a cell phone, and you can film a crime in the country.
You can put a message with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on sound clip and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year of Venice, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city at that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're imagining that all these people who have been coming up and asked to change, had a cell phone in the bag.
Who's got a cell phone in the room?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full information.
Use raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. A brand has signed a legal line.
This is a legal rule of law enforcement.
And this is a rule that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service service in Europe has to store a range of users of users.
Who calls who? Who's going to pick up a email?
Who's sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone companies or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "You don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this free-off-off-off.
We want self-driving in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of these information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "You don't want it."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were looking at the streets of Berlin and saying, "Funessless, not fear."
And some people even said this could be the Stasi 2.0.
Stasi was the head-in-beemin-beardi in East Shenya.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can you really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company who was the Igst Telegraph who was in Germany, and I asked them, please, please send all the information you've stored on me.
And I once asked her, and she asked her again, and she didn't get the right answer. Only another blue blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that you're doing on it.
So I decided to put a court trial on them because I wanted to have this information.
But the post-up post said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came up to be compared to them.
I'll go back to the post, which they all asked me to get information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court department decided that the introduction of the E.U. Convention was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown impact with a CD.
And on the CD, this is what it was.
358.830 lines of information.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical about what to do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what the defenses of the law enforcement means.
So together with online and open data City, I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, and you can go back and down.
You can take every step that I do, you can track.
And you can even see, as I'm going from Frankurturt to the train to K<unk>nn, and how many calls I'm going to do along.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like me, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then a couple of friends call me and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call you, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building map for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to whom someone who's sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of the fall of 1989 phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi had known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stya had known who the leaders were, that would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall may not have happened.
And then, of course, the case of the iceberg of the iceberg.
Because today, local agencies and companies want to store so many information that they can get over us, online and universal.
They want to have the possibility of tracking our lives, and they want to store all the time long term.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They have to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your prostitut, just because companies and state digits have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to get your information that you've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight the self-assembly of the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spiderian shops, rapid restaurants, Brachops.
So the map of the map is going to meet and then continue to change the name of South Central to make it different, and it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going on in the city wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spider shops, rapid-speed restaurants, refrigerators.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert, South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Ahrannus and the Drivebys.
The comor is that the Drive-in-in-in-in-law kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles for weapons.
So, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than about Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even see that anymore.
And I asked myself how you would feel if you had no access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that have the total food system on your neighborhood.
I'm holding out that Rolling's roll and sold like the use of the railroad.
I see comedy centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food.
I didn't have any fun of over 45 e-minute taxs to get an apple that's not underproduction.
So I planted a food bar before my house.
It's a piece of land we call park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to engage it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it in the state."
And I decided to keep it in the outside.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grances, and together we started to plant my food corridors and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a professional group, together from hives from all the social layers and from the city, and it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically raised me a ticket, and he said I have to remove my garden, the bill was a masterpiece.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A master of breeding resources for food prices on a piece of land that you're totally not?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the town and talking to a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on Change.org and 900 protords, we were successful.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why should they not do that?
L.A. has the most levers in the United States.
They have 2.5 miles of trach.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my "The Leverage Collider," I tell people they should grow their own food.
To grow its own food is like printing its own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconceional reality that was made by other people, and I'm going to make my own reality.
Look, I'm an artist.
Communication is my graffiti. I'm going to pick my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, hercuppel the walls, I'm going to shuffle lawn and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my discourse for this stuff.
You'd be surprised by what the Earth's soil can be if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine flower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You'd be wondering how kids are influenced by this.
The most parbling is the therapeutic and the most bold act you can do, especially in the city.
And you also get strawberry straws.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the end of the road."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only made me more vulnerable to doing this. People asked me, "Fin, you don't fear people to steal your food."
And I said, "It's the devil, no, I'm not afraid they're going to tickle.
It's the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
In another time, I put a garden in this homeless house in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to borrow the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it has influenced them and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it only has to be a moment.
Green Grances have already planted about 20 gardens.
So our way to our people, we got out of our way to the world, and they would do 50 people, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon dioxide.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoatoes.
But if they don't get anything from it, if they don't get shown how food and body people are going to be blind, and they eat them, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see color kids that are exactly on the path that they were looking for, and they don't even get anywhere.
I see the hangers as a chance of training these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could generate the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-fuff, because free is not sustainable.
The comjective of sustainability is that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're learning the joy of honor and honor when you build their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to become all environmental returns, gang-pullers, gang-cullers.
We have to turn the image of the ganglight.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang gang.
You're going to be able to get a hug, you know?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you want to sit in a game store and make a meeting where you're talking about doing some pits.
If you want to meet me, you come with your shit, in my backyard, so that we can plant some pits.
Leaders. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollyogry."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nollygoster" means "in-for-for-profit."
Although a newspaper publisher in the 19th century, a better definition of a master, "A Greybuoy, somebody who is a foreign office, independent party or executive, and his success by the pure power of the prominating pricentiality."
I have no idea what the memory is.
Something that I think is.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
177, for instance, the British Parliament had to be able to get newspapers, not the exact same word of debut.
And this actually went back to the man's man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby who was introduced to Parliament.
They threw him in the Tower of London and they shook him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to fight, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so too much as Brass." Many people think.
Brass is a word for the English word for a bar.
But that's not true. It's going back to a government of liberation.
But to show you how words and politics are interfered, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it's just reached independence.
You saw the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Dutch nation?
and that's been debated for a long time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Israel Washington, and others, his Congodoxity George Washington, and again, the propension of the freedom of the people of the United States of Washington.
Not so much more sensitive.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought that was a viable one.
They were not monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored by bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal of a viceman who is constantly writing, "I've been thinking about the same issue."
The reason for the shutter and the bored was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good dealer. They didn't want him to do it.
King call up, and maybe even give him ideas to their own.
They wanted him the most vulnerable, more stumbling, more shiny title that they might find.
This title was "Pory."
President. They didn't invent the title. He happened before. But he just meant someone in a gathering.
It's kind of like the pre-eason of a jury.
He didn't have more size than the "The Scise" or "depass water."
Sometimes there were young protests and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
So the Senate refused to give him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign advertisements.
Who gets serious to take him if he has a stupid little title like President President President of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't have to go.
Instead, you want to be a sense of the word "dist" as a cartoonist," but they wanted to make absolutely clear that they were not agreed for their honest respect for the opinions and the institutions of civic nations, whether it's in the Republic of monarchy, where it's the state of the state of the state of the state of the state, not to be more respected, but to the President, the people in the United States, the other nations, the people who
You can learn three interesting things about them.
First -- and I think that's the best thing to do -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate ever signed up the cover of President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he only wailed the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says something temporary -- you wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that "Pearst the United States President of America" is not as humbling as well, right?
That's something more than 5,000 nucleic swowers that he has and the largest economy in the world and a bunker drone and all this stuff.
The reality and history have given the title of size.
And so the Senate ended up.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern about the principal, the type of self-exqueness -- well, it was like this.
But do you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear fireheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost, because nobody feels more humbling when you're told that you're the president of America now.
And that's the most important thing you can take from, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually change reality much more than words of reality could ever change the words.
Thank you.
So I came to a train with about 50 Rejection to fight to Wujalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian concert from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to put my black Concessive gloves against a pair of brown leather and crains and crush a rocket in the state-fount that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I was born with the war, but I was then raised by Pyjama party and football and training and fighting and fighting with a racist South-state and racial protests who never lived with the communism and lived in Afghanistan and worked with Afghanistan and documenting and documenting the observations before I knew what was going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here, a more seductive Afghane, South nations of God Kittablet, a atheist and a radical political artist who lived in Afghanistan last nine years, and he's created.
So in Afghanistan, there are lots of great things that you could do about art, but personally, I don't like to paint rain shores, and I want to make art that would stimulate the personalities and reuse and re-explroduce reality and even the kind of imaginary peoples to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day of an jihad -- a guy who is using his jihad against communist like "Popird Blord," and he uses armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad be asked for Parliament and making a choice campaign with the slogan: "Bake me! I'm jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to let these Mafiosiosi, who are spending as an Asian hero.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, and with a project called "tiffing," where you're going to be a police officer, a false control station on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of money from them, and giving them money to the names of Kabul, and the police, and they hope that they're going to give us 100 percent of them to us.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan became the "modit conflict."
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture, by creating a fashion of soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put the hives of indigenous Afghan possessions with a protective or multiple interfinational and diverse-towned and unethical-real.
And I'd like to see how a simple scarf looks from Kabul between Kipliffiffell of 189999999999 to create a dialogue about the development development development development of the past-downed major rhetoric about the White King, to have the brown man, to even protect him and even to even survive a little bit of civil society.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misuse.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self is worth the geography of self.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and for some time, I work as a model.
For 10 years, just said.
I feel that now, in the room, there's a kind of unlimited tension in the room, because I shouldn't have been wearing this dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is going to be engaged on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happy to see that.
If some women were really stupid when I came out, you don't need to say this to me now, I read on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which you think of me.
That's not everybody has the chance to do that.
These incisions are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you'll all be embarrassed by me, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it's not that embarrassing as this image.
A visual image is powerful, but it's also a visual, it's also super-ficial.
I've changed my opinion in six seconds.
And in this image -- I've never had a friend in reality.
I was very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgery or the wrong valleys that I've been trying to do two days ago, there are very few ways of changing our fears, and our quizess -- although it's super-exportable -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be uncomfortable, to me, is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a beautiful white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but to the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became an model is a profit in the genetic lottery and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in terms of wonder, we're biologically programmed, but also as big, tortured, feminine and bright-and-white.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical of this point, and maybe some fashion-in-dresss call, "Hirst. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smake. Liu."
And first, I'm commenting your model, you know. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all of the modules that were counted on the course of the course of the course of the day, each single single one that was being executed, and that in fact, from 67775 microcreators only only had 27 or less than four percent of them were not white.
The next question that I'm always asked to myself is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be done.
You can become President President President of the United States or the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja Heart Moneman, which would be totally wrong, because you would be the first one."
When they still say this great deal for this great, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of the American bird or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that later, you want to become a model, as if you're going to say, you want to get the Jack Behrto in the server.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of a more recent model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be degraded.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice ball, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to go to the room," and then the first thing you want to do is go, beautiful, and long, this arm goes back to the back, and the head is round, and you just move back, and you can just see, and you see, you see, you see, you know, you know, you know,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less odd than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you've done a lot of work and you've got a few jobs, you can't say much more. If you want President President President of the United States, but you're going to be in life, "10 years of interpide, you're going to be considered weird.
The next question that I often asked myself is, "Who is all the photos?"
And yes, so pretty much all the photos are being cut, but this is just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was also the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
This is what I saw just a few months ago with my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this shuttle.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago for a rockwalk for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructed, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and mobile pioneers and photographers and Brylists and Brylists and the Twester and the Twice and the Twice. They're building.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Do you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot gloves that I can never wear, except it's the things I get free, things that I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I drove my friend, a horrible driver, and she went over and she got a red light, and of course we were stopped. It just took a "invention, Mr. Pew," and we could go further.
I have these costless things for my appearance, and I don't have people who are paying for their personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not pay for their personality price.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and smoked in the last year, 85 percent black and Latino and alphans and mostly young men.
It's only 177 young black men and Latino people who are not asking the question: "Am I listening?"
But, how often am I going to stop? When am I going to stop?"
And I found out of my research on this talk that 53 percent of all 13 years of all-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and bright hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backside, we give a response that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel as much as it is, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I happier if I had thin legs and gloomy hair?"
Then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest flawy pets, and they are the ones that are probably more vulnerable women on the planet.
When I prepared this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to move a more honest balance, because on the side, I felt very uncomfortable to get here and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile that was so dicked to my ass." And it feels very good to turn it up, and it doesn't feel very good to turn me up, "And that makes me happy."
It was very difficult to really close a legacy of oppression for gender and race if I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've been able to get here before 10 or 30 years old, and my career was even more unfinished, because I would probably not tell my first job, or maybe I would have been able to tell myself how I was not going to be a college, which is so important now.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misfortived success and error.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, leafi resistance. He hated him.
But never will be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been nearly two years since the Dutch revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass media and both in the Egyptian revolution.
I connected with many other Libymen, within and outside of Leymens to challenge a day of anger and start a revolution against the tyrannian regime of Gadquacrosis.
And there she was, a large revolution.
Young, Leby-law women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the authorities, and then slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved an excellent mutant by putting them against the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east to the far east to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to prevent the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a large home, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for development.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regimes and both infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the pink-obal society.
The devastation and the challenges, I would consciously ban how many other women are going to rebuild civil society farms. We asked ourselves to create a defensational transition to democracy and national success.
Nare 200 organizations were formed during the same time and immediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshop to the issues of human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Leyier women, a movement of women, leaders of different lives, whose goal is to be public-based leadership for women, and to stand up for our right-being of democracy and education.
In the election, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was more powerful and more polarized. It was a community that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and reconciliation.
I led a campaign to peacebuilding platform for women to achieve a responsible choice, a law that every citizen should choose or whatever, to vote and to decide the right, and to have an opportunity for political parties between the African and female leaders and to the horizontal level and to make a difference.
At the end of the initiative, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation-class government in the first elections for 52 years.
But slowly, the euphemity of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we were thinking about new news messages of violence.
A morning we were looking for the ban about preservation of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And again, another morning, the murderers were signed by the armed forces.
And indeed, every day, we were looking under the governor of the military and their ongoing competitors against the human rights and their contemptors of rules and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary mind, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles of principles and policies, dignity, social justice, who at the beginning.
Strange, rejection and revenge became the icon of the "Folagime" of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success of our discourse and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to admit that as a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We made our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security to Lybia.
Is the re-excession and the transition between women and male leaders and national resurrection?
No, it's not.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and mastery and both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gehade and the ununcession.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus as it needed to have the elections, which at the end, has only increased the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the more profitable embodiment of the female than it takes the numerically, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop calling the name of anger and ask one day of the revenge.
We have to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't just blame the next values, but also to be honest: Goffard instead of revenge, instead of collaboration, no competition, no-expective.
These are the ideals that are desperately forced by war to get peace.
Because peace has a nightmare and in this alchemie, it's about the refinational of feminine and paterpillate view.
That's the real nonsense.
And we have to do this in a very well-organized basis before we do it sociologically.
After a judge from the Koran "Salam" -- peace "the word of God, Sugst."
The word "raver" again, which is known in all the late posthamhaman traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "The World," and symbolized the matterine feminine, which is surrounded by all humanity, the men and the men's male men and the female, all of the tribes and all have gone from.
And just like the mother's blood in the embryo that grows in it, completely surrounded the underlying self-deemination of compassion.
So we said, "My Gard always always puts things."
So we said, "My Gnard has been pre-deed in front of my sum."
Let all of us to be saved by the garnal of the Gnard.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often asked myself how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until I could go to a whole change point.
When I first saw a public drill, I thought, in North Korea, was normal.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from the sister of a colleague of mine.
And he said, "If you're listening to this, our five family members of the world will not be more because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
In short, I went down to the station and I saw some horrible thing that I can't delete from my memory.
A poor woman was on the ground, and a stuttered child in her arm was so stiffed in his arm.
But nobody helped them because they were all busy doing so much for caring for their families.
In the mid-'99s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were used to sacrifice, and many more people survived because they ate grass and beetles and sea ice.
Lacing weights were more likely to be worse, so at night, as everything was so dimged by the lights of China on the other side of the number of people we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't have lights there.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amloids, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you see, the river can be very rough, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many are dying.
Sometimes I saw bodies going into the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that I was sent to the violent years of famine to the distant relatives of China.
I just thought I was separated for a short time of my family.
I never thought it's needed to live in 14 years.
In China, it was very difficult to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a Northcorean refugee, but soon I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day my biggest Alpt Opera Station was true when I was trapped by the Chinese police police police and sent to the police department.
Somebody complained to being North Koreore, so they tested my Chinese fears and asked me many kinds of questions.
I was so afraid of being able to explode my heart.
Would anything supernatural appear, I could be locked in and out of it.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made it to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the pollination, a elected officer said to the other, "That was a false statement.
It's not North Koreore singer."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans, he's going to go to China in foreign messages likeyl, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police police police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they finally were released by massive international pressures.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China, and they are covered by North Korea, where they were tortured, or they were being rebuilt and used to be local.
Although I was lucky with my honor, it's not that many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identity and having to fight hard for survival.
After they learned a new language, and they found work, their world can be put on a moment in the head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was going to be able to leave myself in South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I also saw the difference between North and South Korea.
We are all Korean, but inside we have very different from each other, because of 67 years of the part.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no longer a country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't really get the rest of the southern Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording test for university.
Just as I was more committed to my new life, I got a shocking call.
The North Sudan administration began the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the way to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself back to the north-Kestern border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run it up to more than 2,000 miles across China and then to South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've been almost caught several times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all of them and started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they'd be executed.
When the Chinese official promised my family, I was accepted, and he said she was a stuttery, and I was her seminar.
He looked at me in a grugy, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get it to the la la la la la-Ecean, but I had to put almost all my money to the border of Laos.
But even after we've been crossing the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border destruction.
After I paid money sentence and paid money, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was replicated in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything to avoid my family to liberty, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and went between the immigrant and the police department, and I tried to free my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then the voice asked me to a man, "What's going on?"
I was quite surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without being able to go to a bank, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him for the very heart of my own heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I'll help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger who had been criticized for me to create a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
After our long journey, my family and I were all back in South Korea, but the freedom to get to the third.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside, because many of us are still in contact with family families, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from within.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to be more hopeful to be successful with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans all over the world, including TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good sight.
It can't speak, but it communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers might not be.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide them in ruthless, and he's putting them away.
It's not a nasty one. He's not listening to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine, he never told a lie.
When he sang songs from our childhood, trying to words that I still remember, reminds myself of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown unknown.
Samuel's 16th. He's very good. He's very good.
He has an absolutely meaningless memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate beacon, but he remembers the paper of every week from my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four months old, while the first result of the teombagies on my arm, and he'd be wearing a lady's Day party.
Don't they listen to it?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind is not fit in the social version of normal, they are often being over and understood.
But what my heart encouraged me and my soul was that, although that was the case, although they were not considered as common, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autonomism," it's a complex function of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different in each individual, and it's called Remi's so different than Sam.
And over the world, every 20 minutes of autism is observed, and although it's one of the fastest growing development interventions in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm living autism, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was only three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He cried a lot.
He didn't want to play the same thing that the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me.
Remi lived and he was rained in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like cars in a row of space, to eat the washing machine and eat everything from him.
And when he became older, he became different, and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the ravel and the never end of hyperactivity was something that was a very unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being never had ever been executed.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of my family, that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going back to the idea of things that they've taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I would not want to trade against normality.
So the normality is the beauty that give us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only tell you one thing about ii and to Sam and you, it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in common, and in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normal environmentalism is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edockon has filled us with awe and curiosity with this photo, with a project of a robot, and he's going to be through a mass-furpight period of an only a millionth-century period.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtototo-T photography, a new design technology that's so fast to create time-pressing animation of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at the opposite of our perspective or can't look at corners of the body and really make a question about what we call " camera."
So if I take a laser clip and turn it into a billionth- second-by-half-second -- these are several Femtotoseconds -- I'll build a package of photons that hardly only has a third-sized, and this camera pack, this project, will move in speed, speed, and it's going to be speed, and it's going to be -- a bigger than a million times faster than a project.
So if you take this project, this photons pack, and you take it into this bottle, how are these photons going to break in the bottle?
What's the light in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So think about this, actually, this event takes less than a nanoscosis -- so long as the light to get back to that lane -- but I'm going to get this video to be the 10 billion billion billion to see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photon pack, which starts moving through and then melt inside.
And part of the light is turned out outside the table, and you see these spread from waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately going to reach the juice and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going to be flattening around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread from the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and you take it back and you slow the video back to 10 billion years, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-time photography?
You can see again, as these waves of the table, that flips Tomel and the wall over the back.
It's like when you put a stone into a pond.
It seemed like the nature would paint this picture, every single-to-to-A-screen image, but of course our eye looks a mixed image.
But if you look at this Tom on the other hand, you'll see that when the light is going to turn up, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom Spight is a Saturday, and the light goes around and comes back to a few billionth seconds.
So in the future, if this Femtoto camera is built in your Camerahychy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if a grown-up, without touching it at all.
So how did my team at MIT built this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you're going to make a photo with a short time of time, you have very little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your shortest time of wartime, so you're getting pretty good light.
So what we do is we send this project, this photons, a million times, and we draw it again and again with very clever synchronization and combine these gigabytes of data to create these Ftoto-R videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and make very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes, can you see corners?
The idea is that we're going to put a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to be reuse, go into the room, part of it will be reflected back back to the door, and eventually we could use these more extracts of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femtototo camera.
And behind the wall is a soup hidden, and we're going to let the lights down on the door.
After our paper was published in the Proimal Communications department, it was taken by Nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to cut this light project and then we're going to push it back to this wall and then you're going to be able to put it in the wall and you're going to be able to be able to move into all directions and then we're going to get our little bit of the photons and then you're going to break the back and then you're going to the camera, and then you're going to get to get to get
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femtototo camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time-term solution, and it can look at the world at speed speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the ones that are in the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is about.
By adding a laser to light, we can take a plastic image that looks like -- how do you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but if we take many of these pictures, dozens of these images, and try to turn them together, analyze the different light-through light, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a lot of things to do before we can do this in the lab, we could build cars, and we can avoid the collisions, and we can see what's on the curve, or we can search on the dangerous breeding circles of survivors by looking at light, reflected through open windows, or we can build endcopes, and we can see the deepest skin around the sky and the palm of the palm of the sandscopy and the sandscopy.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, why is this really a rollup for scientists to think about Femtoto-in photography, because a new digitization process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problem?
So, like Doc Edpton, a scientist, a scientist, has become a art of ultra-transcess photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, we only use the scientific image, we can create a new form of computer photography, and we can only see that kind of color and color, and we can't just look at these waves between time.
But it's going to happen here.
If you look at these waves under the handshell, you see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've seen almost in speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have liked this picture incredibly.
The order to happen in events in the world, appear in the camera in reverse order, so by taking the overall relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether for photography to focus around corners or create a new visualization for medicine or new composition, since our invention, we've been able to open up all the data and detail on our website, and hope that the "to-in-profit," the innovative and the research community, to let us stop the billion-dimensional perspective, to begin to begin to begin to the next axis-dimensional perspective, and to the next-dimensional perspective of our next-dimensional imagery, to the
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our human beings can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the arguments are not passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like a pair of trader, and then use codons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rents are you paying my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without giving us?
How can we share our memories of the limitations of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for sustained homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is ripped by the huge spaft that had been leveled for hundreds of years, drunk and crissors and crissors. I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time someone never ever did, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the rest-of-the-art areas in America.
I live in the near of this house and I thought about how I can get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpectedly.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I've felt a great grateful thing for my life, and it's really really motivated me about the things that I've been interested in in life now.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a side of the house into a giant blackboard and wrote with a brothlele on the gaps: "I want to die," I want to -- everybody who comes from, can take a piece of chalk, think about his own life and share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and she grew.
I want to share some sentences with you, written by people from the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on the International Record."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live "weaving"."
"I'm going to die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I'm going to die, I want to be a guy's Kavallillape."
"I'm going to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes of people and dreams brought me to laugh, to the wine and the quiet times during the hardest period.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's about a new way of self-explicating.
It's about creating space for participation and thinking and remembering what we are most important as we grow and changing.
I've made this last year, and I've got hundreds of passionate messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their communities, so my colleagues and I've built a building and I've been building a building and now in the world like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have when we have the opportunity to connect our voices to other people.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view and thinking about life is short and sensitive.
We're often accustomed to talk about death or even thinking about it, but I realize that preparation is one of the things that we are most empowered.
The idea of death is how we make life happen.
Our common spaces are the best that we are important as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories, people can not only help us to create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved with a very special problem for anyone who's been involved in post-exmed math is that we're like business servant.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today, I'm going to try to explain what I do.
Teaching is one of the most human activity.
We're looking at the face of the grilling ball and the roders, as you're going to see in the same way.
For example, a ballet is an extraordinarily large amount of knowledge and abilities, and potentially a fundamental set of evidence that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly breaking this extraordinary capacity. That's what it does with my fellow people in the Berraves Janves, who was a balletvirosis at the time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unconditionable symptoms like weaknesses, treons, and other people who are living more, so we need to discover objective resources before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is cure, if we have an objective measure of solving that question.
In trouble, there are no biomarkal activity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test for neurologists.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical studies, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't be a expensive hospital.
It's also 300 percent of the way to look at neurologic area.
So I want to suggest to you a unconventional method that we try to achieve this, because we're all in some sense, virtual, virtuos like my fellow Janves.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This happens in the healthy state, when someone's writing sounds like a vote maker, we can look at our right ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs if we built clay, and we all have the genes for FoxP2.
And as ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it.
And by clicking, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and as the receiver is also affected by Parkinson's vocal muscles.
On the lower line, you can see an example of irregular vocal combustion.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Simpor, weakness, weakness, siness.
The language is even more and more ephemious and more and more, and this is an example ofymptom.
And this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and risk analysis, combined with new machine learning learning that are now very advanced, and we can now figure out where someone is in a Spannex disease between health and health, only because of the vocal vocal vocal vocal muscles.
How can these tests measure these clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test with neurologists.
It's so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are exactly accurate. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done by their own.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely cheap, you can use it in very high scale.
So these amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through higher observation.
We can do low-cost mass-scale methods for clinical trials, and we can first be able to do a study of the entire population.
We now have the possibility of looking for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's brain-driven.
With Aculab and PatientsLike, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data data, for the profit of these goals.
We have synlegs that are more accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, without Parkinson's disease, can call cheap to leave pictures for a few cents. I'm familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of samples, say 10,000 people, then you can say who is healthy and who?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the call has to give up whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to get to the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to choose to identify what the actual markers of Parkinson's disease are.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy has to be true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to confuse him because he's done this amazing work -- now showed that it's working on the mobile network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a more improvement.
That means people can -- people can call the phone phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, make their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Small, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the eastern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and that behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a little bit of a straight in the South, so that means that wildlife animals can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buitch.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the Middle East of the sky, and so that's why our animals mean so much.
I was learning lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our fathers. They are also put on this problem for this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible between six and nine years for the cows of his father, so I did.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions are afraid of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but help the lions see the cows better.
But I didn't have to do it. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to check it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to go next to the cowall.
But lions are very smart animals.
You can see the bird flies and go back and forth, but they come back and they say, "Oh, the thing doesn't move, that's still here.
And they take their hand and kill our livestock.
One night, I was looking at the Stall. I was walking around a papel in the hand and I didn't beat the lion.
Beood fear of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I used to work as a young boy all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio of my mother apart, and one day, she almost brought me around. But I've learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a direct drive from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn up on the right or left. He's going to be blind.
And I turned on a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights.
This is a small black leaf from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar bubble is absorbing the battery, the battery, it's providing electricity to the correct power, and I call it a transactor.
And the right-being is bright.
You see that the flowers are coming from the outside, because there are lions.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are bright and the lions believe that I'm going to go around the rubble. And that's what I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been running this with us at home, and since then we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard of it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many animals of her animals, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. They can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, also for other predators like hygiene or leopard seals, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged, and it helps by donations and education.
I even put my friends home and we install the lights there where there are no lights there, and I'm going to show people how to use them.
A year ago, I only had a boy from the savanna who was crying his father's cows. I saw planes on me and said, "I'm going to sit in a room!"
And here I am.
I was allowed to sum up with an airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. This is my great dream.
I used to be a lion. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and we can grow the lions together. We can live side with lions without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing about the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An electrode?
Yes, I know electric tires have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it again, not true -- yes, I've tried it again, but I've been given the try back because I got a stroke.
All right. Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to feed you on each step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I've never made one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even reversed the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story begins when I was a lecture in New York, and my wife made this picture, where I gave my daughter to my first birthday on my arm, and we were on the corner of 57th and 5-four.
And so this is exactly a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to take the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on?
When my third birthday told me about my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you want Sabina to New York and do it a father-old lady's brother account to lead the ritual?"
And then we started asking tour tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you take a complete stranger.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, somebody is never touched by our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is only a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a handful of time, or a specific journey.
They are also a way for us to be able to keep the time in October and to change our time and how we move from year to year, not only physically, but in everything.
Because although we're always doing the same image, our perspective of time is changing, and as they're coming to the new fragments, I can see life with their eyes, as they deal with everything they see.
And this very intense time that we spend with each other is something we appreciate and expect to be free every year.
Lastly, as one of our travels, we went for a walk, and suddenly she stayed as disgusted, and she shows a red bar on a barlet, which she had learned as a young child, at earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had thought of as five years of age in exactly this place.
She said she remembers her heart of her chest when she saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York because she's really interested in studying in New York.
And I realized it was obvious: the most important thing that we all build is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know how it looks like in your own, but apart from these 15 pictures, I'm hardly a family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and not ask someone to ask, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
