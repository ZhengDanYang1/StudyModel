When I was 11 years old, I was standing in one morning from the sounds of the strange joy.
My father heard on his little, white radio show the BBC's news.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual, because he was very familiar with the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it really made my father very happy.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
This morning I'm never going to forget.
A right school.
The Taliban had the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and I was illegal to go to school.
So I was so upset for five years old, and I was amazed by my older sister who didn't have to go to a secret school.
Only as we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to guess, that nobody could guess where we went.
We're going to put our books in a supermarket so that it looked like we'd just go to buy.
We're in a house, about 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was unfinished, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we had our lives, teachers, students, and our parents.
After all, the students suddenly had to go out for a week, because the Taliban had stopped.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are you going to ask us?
Did you know where we live?
We had scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a great fortune to grow in a family where education had been important and daughters.
My grandfather was far before his time.
A foreign of a slave in Afghanistan, and he was to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was convicted by his father.
My mother's grown up, but my teacher was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the workforce, just to turn our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first thing was in his family who ever received education.
For him, it was always clear that his kids would get a education, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk to send his kids to school.
I know that I've been so frustrated in the Taliban, sometimes, in the time, it was so frustrated by our lives, from the constant fear and the subject of despair.
I was good, and my father said, "Toy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can get stolen. You can get out of the war from your house.
But one thing you're going to stay, which is in there, and even if we have to pay our blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give me a question?
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women, a higher marriage, and when my family didn't have been treated so much for my education, I would have one of those women.
Instead I'm here today, as a proudist of the English teacher.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was convicted by his family, because he was told to send his daughters to school, one of the first ones that I've been encouraged to do.
He's not just going to be with my graduate school, but also that I was the first woman, and that's what he's driving with the car with Kabul.
My family believes me.
I have great dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women.
So I've helped to start to start to start to start the BigLA, and maybe the first public public school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school students are still less risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school with great property, who would want to look at all the opportunities.
And you see how their parents and fathers are in the same time, including my parents, despite all the time and beyond all the time.
Like Ahmed. This is not the real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
About a month, his daughter was on the home of CalLA, and she's the death of a bomb just for a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone is sent, and he got a voice, and he released him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try to try it again.
He said, "I'm going to leave you now, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future for your old and un-douching ideas."
What I've discovered in Afghanistan is something that is often told in the West: the majority of us who have success is a father who knows the value of his daughter and that's true that it's success.
It's not going to be hot that our mothers don't really think of a difference in our success.
In many ways, they're often aware of the ones that are more accurate and more compelling for the most promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, the support of men.
After the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, we can see three million girls in school.
Afghanistan seems like America, like this.
Americans recognize how secure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not from the long-term, and they're going to change with the United States's population.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are doing it for them, they're going to be a very promising future and a more competitive change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unconventional possibilities, and remember the girl who visit the BRLA.
It's like I have a big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, including a life -- was defined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- I've -- I've got in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Somalia and Somalia with the technology with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian campaign, and every single project we did on the legs, failed.
I was so scared.
I thought, 21 years ago, we're a good people, and we're good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, what my first book was called "Rayhay, in Zamia, was one where we wanted to show the Alianiaia of the people like food.
We came to the Italian seed in South America, in this valley, which is going to be the Sami Mountain, and we've been teaching the local population of the local population and the Russian tomato and Pulie.
Of course, the local had no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they found it.
We were amazed that there was no waste of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they don't get to do anything, we just said, "God is that we're here."
"Tight time to save the people of Sambia before the Enrace."
Of course, all of course, all of course, wonderful in Africa.
We had this great tomato sauce. In Italy, they were so large, in Sambia,
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Samban, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato and red were red, about 200 Natil, it came out of the river and everything.
We said to the Samban, "Oh God, the Nil!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why did you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were a French, and I saw a great, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English community did, and when I saw what they did, I was pretty proud about our project.
We're at least putting the pier.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the mislood that we've had to have no longer to have human beings.
They should read the book "The Dead Aad Aad" from Dada Moyo, she's a sub-profit scientist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent of a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was.
Just read her book.
Take an African-in-one, what we've been doing.
We are Western people, the Colombianists, the mission, and there are only two species, as we deal with people. We're also criticizing them or we're atheist.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "Vast."
But they have two different meanings.
Psychology: I'm going to keep myself myself myself to have a different culture, and I'm like to you, "I love you so much."
Patronis: I'm going to give every other culture when they were my gay.
So the way that white people are called "Sood," director,
I was shocked when I read the book "Sindy" by Shingery". He said, especially in economics, if people don't want to help, then they're going to stop.
This is the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Today, the gentleman who opened this conference, a bus on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't fair for you?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and we decided to get a system called a company that never has to be involved, never to have a service of the local love, the local man, the local man, the dream of the dream, the dream of a better person.
What you do -- you get the mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you get together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafs. We're going to meet in Kellen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to look at friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like what you want to do?
The passion for your own growth is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of going to a community and say what they should do to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community groups.
entrepreneurs never have a part of it, and they're never going to say what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
Design has this blind spot.
The most popular people in the community don't know because they never seem to public meetings.
We're working one to do this, and we've got to do that, we've got to be able to get a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be created.
This is the house of the company, the house of the business that you're sitting in the house, in your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you to find the means to change your passion in a way that life is going to change.
I tried this in the field, West Africa, trying to do.
I used to go to time, and I tried to get the cold-tiff-towing, where we're going to tell other things about what they should do to get away.
And so I went through the first year, and I had only the streets, and in the first three days, I helped him. He was in a garage, and he was a Maii. I helped him to sell him to a restaurant, and then the fishermen said, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, the Mai, you're going to help us help us help us help us help us help us.
I helped them work with these five fish, and this wonderful tuna not to sell a factory in Somalia for 60 cents, but after Japan for 15 dollars to D<unk>KK, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, do you help them help us help us help us help us?
In one year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very difficult.
I'm listening to the mouth and listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Let's try it again."
We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the competition.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be involved in loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers of history, died with 85 years ago.
Peter printer was a philosophy of philosophy before he was doing companies. Peter printer said, planning is actually unconditionable with a entrepreneurship society and economics."
Design is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you're building Christian siss, not knowing what the most bad human man's love with her money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to one.
You have to offer them a bit of discourse and privacy. You have to help them, and they're going to get more excited.
In one community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400 thousand people who do intelligence and passion?
For the ones that you've ever heard about today today's presentation.
<unk>"""""""""""""uite passionate, you've got this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- unlusive fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The control engine is not sustainable.
The free-on-surial era is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to build and build them with them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Do you forget!
The government? Do you forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-amist magazine for many years ago.
There was a group of experts who invited to talk about the future of New York in 1970,
In 180, they came together and they were putting in, and they would happen in 100 years, and the end of New York, and the conclusion was that the city would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve, and said, when the population grows in that speed, they needed six million horses to get to get rid of the people, and it would be impossible to get rid of the crap with six million horses.
Because they went to the crap.
180, they see the dirty technology that has been deemed by New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in the United States, there were 1001 cars companies -- 100 dollars.
The idea that another technology had done was the race. There were little factories in the country.
Deary, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of them have to be offered by a discourse.
They don't come to them, and they talk to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, talented and passionate services.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the United States, all of the people have to do is to sell three things: that must be a great product that needs to be a great dealer and the financial crisis.
Do you know?
We've never met one single person who can produce something that can do with the money.
That's not what anything else exists.
This person never been born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 o-Sish companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wice, the first Wallhouse, Ford, Google, and Microsoft.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, but one: not only one person has been founded.
Now, we teach 12-year-old entrepreneurs in Northeastland, and we're going to start teaching students to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransics. The task is the youngest chapter of Richard Brovics, in the first two sides of Richard Brovics, as often as he used the word "to-s" and so much more than "the-the-the-s" and more than "the-the-the-the-the-
Never even "w" and 32 times."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, who have a small pioneer background, in cafs, and Bars, who are going to be willing for them, who is going to be done for someone who has done for this man who says that the subject is, "What do you need?
What can you? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do." Do you think I'm going to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We've been able to support groups of volunteers who are supporting companies to find the ability and people. We've found that the miracle of the local population is that the culture and the economy can change the culture of this community, only by the inspiration, the passion and the ability to experience their own human imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be, Alice is in the philosopherland.
So the Penn State University asked me -- a post-up for communication -- to re-rereating engineers in communication.
I was afraid.
Right. Fear. For those students, with their big brains, and their great books and their great ones, they don't trust me.
But when the conversations developed, he turned me like Alice when she was walking down to the fly of a drone, and a door looked at a new world.
I thought, as I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the thought they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles in the country.
I think to open this door, it needs great communication.
We need to need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers, the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it doesn't happen. I think it's in our responsibility as a policy scientist, to look at these conversations.
But these great conversations don't happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's go.
I want to show you some of the ways you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy, sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, yes?
Say, why is your scientific area so relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that their hand-in-in-in-in-in-in-taughter, but also tells us that your pars, the picids, the picous structure in our bones, because they're important to understand that it's important to treat and treat the vobocococococia.
And when you do that, what you do is, then you're going to call preventable cartoons.
We're a barrier to understand your thought.
I'm sure you could use it, and you know, you know, you know, you know, "Well, you don't just tell you," space and time, what is much more comfortable for us?
We're going to make your sense of understanding, not the same way to get off the level of their level.
As Einstein said, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to make things as easy, but not easier."
You can't tell you about your scientific area without having to deal with trade.
Some of the things that we're looking at is, examples, stories and textists. In this way, you can take us into your mind.
And if you're going to put your work, then let's take the numbers away.
Have you ever asked you why it means "Wave point?"
What happens when someone else is thinking? Another one is going to be weeks, and with these two points of your first audience.
One slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too hard to talk about the work of our brain, and that's how we're doing it, and so we're going to be able to be able to do it very quickly.
This example of Gene's Guets Brown is much more effective. It shows that the specific structure of the prosthetic ability is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the iceberg.
The trick here is to use a single, easy sentence, where the audience is going to lose the memory, even though it can be the trace, and analyze images that are also creating our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few of the ways that we can help us to open this door and see the wonder country, the science and the technology.
And because the engineers I've taught, taught me to connect with the <unk>N.I want to share everything with a equation.
So if you look at your science, and you look at your tweets, you're going to get this through the subject, and you're saying the audience is important, and you're going to get the whole passion with your incredible work, and that's what you've done with, and that's what you're going to do with the meaningful interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really sorry about it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life, and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can take a message to a phone, and we can start a conversation in Egypt.
And with a phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on sound show and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1980, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of May, and we're asking that all these people who had been out of and asked, a phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a phone in that?
Just hold it up.
Please hold your cell phone high, keep it up.
Please hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost every one of them has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830s full of information.
Carrocels.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.S. has a legal line.
This is a legal line of law enforcement.
This line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the entire Europe has to store a variety of anti-drance.
Who calls who? Who is going to send a email?
Who are the text of a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of these information will be used for least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet network.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up, and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said we don't want to get this out-up supply.
We want to use self-interest in digital age, and we don't want to know that the phone companies and Internet services have to store all of these information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin, and said, "Don't mean fear."
And some people even said that might be on the Stya 2.0.
The Stora was the head-in-in-in-in-in-beati in East Songland.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can you really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Trice Institute, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, and I asked them to bring all the information that you've been carrying me over.
And I asked her once, and she asked her, and she said, "No right answer. Only even even even even a half blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that's going to be in the line.
So I decided to put a court of it against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the De-up telephony said, no, we're going to give you this information.
And at the end, it came to a comparison to them.
I'm going to go back to the back of the data that they're going to send me all the information.
Because in the meanwhile, the federal law enforcement decided that the introduction of the E.S. is in the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown, and I got this ugly brown,
And on the CD, that's what it was.
35.830s of data.
First of all, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge deal. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this date.
So I was a bit skeptical, what do I do to do with this?
Because you see where I'm at night I'm sleeping, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what is called the re-reatcession.
So together with online and open data, so I've done this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom out and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can do one step I do, to look at.
And you can even see how I drive from Frankurt, and then we can do some of the calls on the train.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just my wife, and it calls me, and we're talking to a few times.
And then I'll call a couple of friends and call them each other.
And after a while, you call them, and you call it, and we have this huge communications.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see it all.
You see the central figures, who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control the society.
This is a building for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is asked to send a email, that's possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is used for least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said, we're thinking about all these people in the streets of the 1960s, in the late 1980s, in their pocket.
And the Stora knew who was at the demonstration, and when the Stora knew who the leaders were, then that would never happen.
The case of the Berlin wall, maybe not before that,
And then, of course, not the case of the iceberg.
Because today's national agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and so forth.
They want to meet the possibility of taking our lives, and they want to store all the time.
But even self-esteem and life in the digital age is not an contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They need to fight for that day.
So if you go home, you say your friends, that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to say, you know, you're going to go to your bosss, because companies, but you know, companies, and the government, have to go to a certain amount of information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to get the information that you've got about.
So, in the future, every time you use your phone, remember that you need to fight the self-time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: "masthing roads, rapid restaurants, mining spaces.
So the city plan is going to meet, and they thought, "The name of South Central Africa is going to be there for something else, and it changed it in South Los Angeles, and if something changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spissing carmen, dry restaurants, mining restaurants, dets.
Like 25, plus a half million Americans, I live in the food desert of Southwest Los Angeles, the home of the Drant and the Drant.
The trick is that the Drantie's man, more people kill than the Drantys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles, from unrelated diseases.
So the obesity rate in my neighborhood is like five times higher than about the deptly Street, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even remember that anymore.
And I asked myself how you would feel if you had access to healthy food every time you go from the house, the negative effects that have the food system on your neighborhood.
I'm going to buy the doorboard and sold as a plant.
I see a conversation-based centers going out like Starbucks.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a joke to get a apple that is not based on the under-up.
So I sold a food DMald before my house.
It's a piece of land we call park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to do it for it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green D., and we started to get together, and we started to plant my food, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a set of professional group, we're putting together from all the social layers and all around the city, it's totally voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else else is worth.
The city came to me and he had a kind of a bomb, and he said that I have to avoid my garden, that was a conpade to a stranger.
And I thought, "Well, do you get here?
It's a fair set of resources for food-to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the
And I thought, "Cool. Her name for that."
Because that time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopezz, made a story about it, and talked to the city of Chicago, and she gave a petition to Chicago.org. and with 900 samples, we were successful.
We thought the victory was in the hands.
My city even called it, and said that they're helping them and love what we do.
So, why do they not do that?
LA. There are most of the places in the United States in the community.
They have a hundred-mile-mile-and-half feet of the space.
These are 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million nuclear plants.
Why should they find it not good?
By growing the plant, you get 1,000 seeds, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my boss's leadership, and I'm saying that they should grow their own food.
His own food is like to print their own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I got my sons there.
And I'm going to be part of this pre-cussious reality that was made by other people, and I'm going to make my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Office is my graffiti. I put my art.
It's like a graffiti artist, the walls, the walls, I'm going to get out of the cliffs and park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my resources for that stuff.
You'd be surprised what the Earth's soil can do when you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunshine is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you need to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You would wonder how kids are influenced by it.
And the people who are the most psychic and the most cool act that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get a double-up.
I remember that time, when this mother came and her daughter came, it was about 10 to 10 minutes at night. They were in my backyard, and I looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't need to do that.
The garden is not a reason to go to the street."
I've been shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just has been committed to me. People asked me, "Fin, you don't have fear that people will steal your food."
And I said, "No hell, no, I don't know that she's going to be doing what it is.
And that's where it's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to get their health back."
And I put a garden in this homeless peace in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the wheel.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it has influenced them, and how they had been growing with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it has changed, even if it has only been done for a moment.
Green Grens has been able to get about 20 mines.
So to our pre-reamimate events, we've got to get out of 50 people and we're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon dioxide, kids eat gas.
When they grow nuclear, they eat tomato.
But if they're not offered anything that they're not going to get to see how food and body, they eat blind, whatever you're going to do.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see color kids who are at the same way they're in the path, and they're not going to get there.
The ladies I see as a chance where we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Dage.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth's soil, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of mines where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship ship, and they turn it into healthy toilets.
So, you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free boots, because free is not sustainable.
The subject of sustainability is that you have to keep it through it.
I'm talking to people to get work, and children from the streets, and they're going to get the joy, the pride and honor, if you're building your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to get all the green returns, gangmen, gang-class manhood.
We need to turn the picture of gang-sowers.
If you're not a vist, you're not a gang.
You're going to get to the viss, clear?
And let's take the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me with me, don't tell me if you want to sit in the vaginas and make a meeting where you talk about it, to make some of the people.
If you want to meet me, you come with your pets, in my backyard so that we can plant some of the balls.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite cartoons in the entire Oxford English is "nyyyyine."
Because it sounds like this.
And "nyyyyy's means "nesty politicians."
Although a newspaper party party party party, a better definition: "Aaily is somebody who is a charity, independent party, or program, and his success of the weak-sination of the weak-rient dissonation."
I don't know what the "lood" is.
Some of the words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, we had to stop the British parliament, not the same word of the debut.
And that actually went back to the man's man with the extraordinary name of Bracodo who was in the parliament.
They threw him in the bomb in London, and they put it, but he was brave enough, he was more brave, and finally he had so much support in London that he won't win.
And only a few years later, we find the first announcement for "The Filil" as many people believe.
Brensess on the English word for a pub.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to a government government's press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States at the time they're doing it, when they're actually going to get independence.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state, call.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of a utopian nation?
And that's been done in Congress in a moment.
And there was all kinds of decision-making.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Israel Washington, and others, his high-life Washington, and again, after other, the law of the people of the United States,
Not as a kind of a compliment.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought that's the case.
They weren't monististists, they wanted to choose the king for a certain time.
It could have been done.
But everybody was unfinished because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the days of a report that always wrote, "I've done the same issue."
The reason for the fire, and the short was that the Brazilian house was against the U.K.
The front of the house didn't want to be that Washington is doing it. They didn't want him to do it.
King call him, and maybe give him to ideas about their own results.
They wanted to give him the most vulnerable, fears of the most, the most unhappy title that they could imagine.
This title was "Pavecece."
President. They didn't invent the title. He had before. But he just meant that someone was being attacked by a meeting.
It's like a pre-night of a J.S. a pre-nard.
He had no longer been the same size when the "The Scra" or "watil."
Sometimes, President had smaller isolated populations and government groups, but it was really a non-nant title.
So the U.S. led him to the end.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to be judging and foreign officials.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid name like President of America's United States's United States?
And after three weeks of debate, the United States didn't have a question.
Instead, we don't want to use the word, not to use the title of the President, but they wanted to make it absolutely clear that they weren't guilty about their respect for their respect and civilized nations and civilized nations, whether it's the state of the state of the state of the state, or whether it's the state of the state of the world, not necessarily uncading the world.
You can learn three interesting things.
First of all, and I think that's the best -- but now I don't know if the United States ever announced the name of President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he just cried the title. He's just waiting to get the U.K. is active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something is a rapid -- then you're going to wait to see 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of America's United States's United States is not so sensitive, right?
This has been a little more than 5,000-lelf car-like car that he has, and the largest economy of the world and a bets of drone and all this stuff.
But reality and history have given the size.
And so the U.S. won the end.
They have a respect of being honest.
And the other worry about the party, the mislussion of mind -- now it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a President?
147, 147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear war and so forth.
So at the end of the U.S. and the United States lost, because nobody feels so vulnerable, if you're told that you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'm going to leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to control reality, but actually change the reality of the future more than the words of reality than the reality ever could change.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a bar with about 50 orders of fighting in the fight, a 15-year-old, vegetarian concert from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to see my black-and-old pants against a pair of brown pars and rodated a rocket in the back of the government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I was born with the war, but after the Kjafy party and football, and training with the vominant-class and the racial parties that live with the non-violentists that live in Afghanistan and the day, and the non-natial community, and the day of Afghanistan, I knew what I knew before I knew was going to do.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here now, I'm standing here, a man-Americans, South America's Institute. A atheist and a radicalist artist who's been working in Afghanistan, and has worked on.
So, in Afghanistan, there are a lot of great things that you could do about art, but I'm personally like to paint a rain-up, and I want to make art that makes the personality and authority and re-cading and re-cading and re-cading the reality and even the kind of human beings to try to understand the world that we're living in.
I want to spend a day in life of an jihad -- and I want to spend his jihad against the organization, like "Patolese" and treated religious abuse and political corruption.
And what else can make the jihad account when the parliament is willing to do a choice campaign with the message: "Let me do it? I mean jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to get these Maoliiii who are spending as a national matrix.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rove," where you're going to get a police, a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money from them, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the president, they hope that they're giving us 100 of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan, after I think, the "Cultural conflict" is being developed.
The war and the stranger who came to him, have created a new environment for St. and fashion, that you can only capture a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, in which I'm in the local farm of a local farm, or a bunch of palleys of non-thro-thro-thrin-thrues.
And I would like to see how a simple slugy from Kabul, between 1899993 to create a dialogue about this today, that today's development of its roots in the developed collapse of the Dutch S<unk>s, the man's man's man's man's white man, and maybe to protect him a lot of civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, unconditioned.
But I do, because I have to do it because the geography of self is needed.
This is my pay. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, it was like, right.
I feel that now, in the room, I've been able to make a unconditiony tension, because I wouldn't have to get this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of change.
This is the first time someone has to go to TED stage, so you can appreciate happy to see that.
If a few women really really laughed, when I came out, you don't need to tell me that I read on Twitter later.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short, very few seconds, what you think about.
And that's not the chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them before.
The most difficult part is to get the pine on my head, because then you'll all be aware of me, so you're not doing anything long, long, as he's about my head.
Okay.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it's not like this, I'm sure.
A picture is powerful, but it's also a picture of a bit of rough.
I've just changed your opinion of me in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I'd never have a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should bring my back oil and with my hand in the hair.
And besides surgery or the wrong laws that I've been thinking about two days ago, there are only a few of our ways to change our fears, and our fears -- although it has a huge and unregient and unconditional impact -- is a huge impact on our lives.
It's not too afraid to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, and I call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered it," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy and maybe ask you what is that legacy.
Now, in the last few centuries, we don't just have beauty as healthy and young and beautiful, and it's based on what we're doing, but also as big, lesbian, and white leaders.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's given me for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some kind of like a fashion writer, "Hla, Muran. Yanaru!
And first of all, I'm talking about your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very talented Ph.D. student at the time of 2008, and the University of Medicine has already given all the same modification, every single one that was being fired, and that was only by the 137 million or seven percent of them, not known.
The next question that I'm always asked to say is, "Can I become a model when I'm grown?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give this little girl is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can get President of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Brazilian heart attack, which would be absolutely wrong, because then you were the first one."
When they say that great dealer, I'm like, "No, no, Watson, I want to be a model," and I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for nothing, and you could be the boss President of American bird or the business of H<unk>amp;MM, or the next Steven Meis.
And to say that you want to be a model later, that's like, you'd say that you're going to get the guy in the serial.
You can't change it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of thinking about the model of the model, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be achieved.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice tube, and the driver says, "Colon, we want to go to the room, and then we want to go to the first time, and that leg is going to be on, and you're going to move back to the side of the side, and you're going to get to get to the four-year-old friends and you'll just see it, and you
It looks like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you're going to leave school, and a few jobs, you can't tell you, but if you want President President the United States, but in the context, "Tare-four years of life, you're looking at weird."
The next question that I've been asked to you is, "Who is all the photos going to be rejected?"
And yes, so all of these photos are being cured, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was also the first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before my grandmother.
This is me the day I'm on this slide.
My friend had to be told to me.
This is me on a Kafama party, a few days ago, a Shintard for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
It's a tool, and it's a group of participants, from Haociists and Pugers and photographers and protists and all their clients and the evaluation and the production. They're building it.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "You know, you're doing things free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-minute shoes that I'm never going to wear, but the things I get free, things that I get in real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money. And you had the clothes for free.
When I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she was talking about a red switch, and of course, we got to be out. It just took a question, "Mearie, Mr. Teszler, and we could go.
I have paid this without a luxury of my view, and not because of my personality, and there are people who are concerned about their appearance, and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and from the 11,000 teenagers who were stopped and raised in the last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177-old young, black-American and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I crying?"
But I'm going to say, "How often do I get to die? When I'm going to stop?"
And I found out of my research for this talk, that 53 percent of all-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body. And that number is up to 7 percent when they're 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and bright hair, you feel very happy and amazing."
And again, we give a answer that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate, passionate, passionate, passionate, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we've never told before the camera, which I've never told you is, "I feel safe."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you ever ask me, "Well, I'm happier if I had a thin legs and a pink hair?"
And then you should meet some of the models, because they have the most thin legs, and the most profound hair and the most cool ones, and they're the same thing about their appearance of the same, probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I've been prepared to get this talk, it was very difficult to get me, a honest, because at the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to me, and I'm going to say, "I've got all the benefits of a pile that I've been attracted to my water, and it's not very good to me." And then I'm not going to make it happy."
It was very difficult to express an legacy of gender and race, if I'm one of the biggest risk of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done this before 10 or 20 years ago, and my career is still more unfinished, because I would not tell you how I would not tell my first job, or maybe I would not tell my first job, or not like college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our mind, and we're more likely to recognize and mislamciation.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to the ex-fatial life, "Son, pafiism.
But I'm never going to be like a pafahi revolution."
It's almost two years since the Dutch revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-foodings and in the natural revolution as in the Egyptian revolution.
I'm standing with a lot of other nasy, and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyranny regime.
And there was a great revolution.
Boy, Sherie-old women and men were in the first row, the end of the authorities, the end of the government, gave the courage, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved that they've been given by being in the savannai's savii.
They've shown a strong sense of acatism, from the far east, from the western West to the South.
After a time, after six months of dry war, and almost 50,000 deaths, it took us to get our country and to get the tyranny.
But Gafi has left a big home, a legacy of the tyranny, corruption and the foundation of development.
Over four decades, Gafahisian regime and infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the pink-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-s-s-s-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
The liberation and the challenges that I knew, as many other women, that helped the civil society to build with a legitimate and more competitive change in democracy and general.
Nare 200 organizations were born and right after the case of Njahis in Benzia, almost 300 in Tripcoco.
After 33 years of the ex-century, I came back to Lyia, and I started to organize some unique sadness, and I started to organize the issues of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started to bring the peace platform, a movement of women, leadership, of different lives, whose goal is to be public for the leadership of women and our right-being of the women and to the right-being of democracy.
When I met the election, I met a very hard environment, a environment that was more vulnerable, a environment that was defined by the selfish politics and terrorism.
I led a initiative to get a global capital of Leyese women to get a call of an unconventional law, which is to decide to take the right, and to decide for all the public and to lead to a global female population and to a broad-scale and a broad-scale level of female population and a line to make a difference to the other side-to-to-to-step.
At the end of our initiative, we've been able to get to succeed.
Women won nine5 percent of the nation's military elections since the first year, for 52 years.
But slowly, the gray majority of elections, and the entire revolution was to us, because we're going to get to new news from violence.
So one morning we looked at the re-lording of the Dutch and the Sufi leaders.
On one day, we got news about the murder minister of American leaders and the attack on the message.
After another morning, the suicide bombers were given by the army.
And we're really going to be aware of the law of the authorities and their progress against the human rights and their arguments of rules and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles and policies, dignity, social justice, that they had at the beginning.
Uncrition, and the fam, were the icon of the <unk>nol<unk>nime of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with success history of our discourse and the elections.
I'm here today to admit that we've been thinking about as a nation that has made false choices and the wrong decisions.
We've got our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't get peace or security in Lyia.
Did the re-encessive and the shift between female and male leaders and national justice?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to overcome polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the domination and the men and men as women?
Maybe the women weren't the only one who was wrong, but the female values of compassion, the man's and the one.
Our society needs a national dialogue and context of development as they needed to have elections that are only the polarization and fragination.
Our society needs the more vulnerable, more than they need to have the experimental, selfish, the female's female.
We need to stop against the name of the anger, and one day we need to ask the man's seat.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gahah.
We need to develop a female comment, which is not just going to be honest, but also to be honest: Goffnnnnnn't be more than collaboration, instead of collaboration, instead of having competition, or not to make it a piece of competition.
These are the ideals that need to be out of war-thry Lyia to get peace.
Because the peace has a Alchemia, and in this case, it's about the re-excession of the feminist and cusicception.
That's the true thing.
And we need to do that, before we do it, we need to do it, we need to do it, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we
After a call from the Koran "Salam" -- peace, "The word of the Sanny of God, "wissy."
The word "sit" again, that's known in all the late-nay-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-
And just like the mother's blood-stold, which grows in him, has all the reason of the fussing of compassion all of the existence.
So we said, "My God's shit is all the things."
So we said, "My God's got a look at my sist."
Let's take all the rest of the gysty to be cut.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we learned the story of Kim's, but we didn't learn a lot about the world, except America, South Korea and Japan.
Although I wondered how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until I could have a whole change.
And I saw a public re-a-old, but I thought, my life in North Korea is normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had to have to have to suffer hunger.
But in 1995, my mother got a letter with a letter, from the sister, a colleague.
And he said, "If you're in this guy, our five-aged family members are not going to be more because we've been eating for two weeks.
We're on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people in my country were suffering.
In short, I went back to the train, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete myself from my memory.
A black woman was on the floor, and a broken kid in her arm was so cold in his head.
But no one helped them because they were so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the middle of the 1990s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North America, the genocide had to be victims, and many more people have ever been aware of it, because they were eating grass, and the slime mold.
Powers have been more likely to get worse, so at night, it's all kind of like the lights from China from the other side of the population that we had.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the St.C. -- and that's part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you see, the river can be very, very close to the river, and it allows Northstans to escape.
But a lot of die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that I was sent to the old majority of corruption to China.
I just thought that I'd be separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought that it takes 14 years to get more alive.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without living with family.
I had no idea of how life would be as North-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-nood, but I'd soon learned that it's not very expensive but also very dangerous. Because North-anan refugees in China as a foreign immigrant.
So I lived in the more vulnerable fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest Alraard room was true when I was trapped from the Chinese police and sent to the police department.
Somebody told me to be Northwest-K. so they tested my Chinese fears, and asked me many more questions.
I had so afraid of that, I thought I would lose my heart.
If there's something that seems like that, I could be fired and be rejected.
I thought that's the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer the questions.
After they were done with the questions, a leader said to the other, "That was a false deal.
She's not Northma-old."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Westans, he's going to be able to get out in China in foreign messages calledylyl, but many of them are being rejected by the Chinese police.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they got caught, they finally passed out because of massive international pressure.
These North Americans didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, there are many North Korea in China, and after North Korea, where they were being rejected, or used to be in public.
Although I had my happiness, it's not that many other Northstans.
It's tragic that North America is hiding their identity and need to fight hard.
After they learned a new language, and work, their world can be asked at a moment at the moment.
After 10 years of the time of the memory, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've noticed the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the Japanese, but in the inside, we've been very excited about it, because of the 14 years of that.
I was in a identity crisis.
Am I the South or Northwest-Kanan?
Where am I going to? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't get the movement of the South-an-an-nan-nat-nant life, I had a plan.
I've been doing a research for the university.
Just as I was treated in my new life, I got a scary call.
The Northanan authorities started to get the money that I sent to my family, and as punishment, was to get my family to go to a remote place in the country.
They had to be as fast as possible as possible as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Korea have to go back to a incredible route to the freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me back to the edge of the North Central Central border.
Because my family didn't talk to Chinese, I had to bring them to more than 2,000 miles from China, and then after South Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've been almost a few times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the kind of thing from all of us, and he started asking questions.
because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be rejected.
When my Chinese officer said to me, I was asked to say that she was a pist, and I was her to be a pist.
He looked at me. He said, "I'm sorry, but fortunately he believed me.
We managed to get it to the o-E-E-E-Cat border, but I had to have to do almost all my money to get the border of Lya,
But even after we've been to get the border, my family was in unlamined because of illegal border.
After I paid money and paid for paid, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family, was replicated in the capital of Lya.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to get my family to the freedom, and we were so close to that, but my family was arrested, just before the South-an-an-American message.
I went to the front and I went to the out of the battlefield and the police department, and I tried to avoid my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and I explained my situation, and without a way, he went to a bank, and paid the money for my family and two two Northians to get them out of jail.
I was very proud of him, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I'm going to help the Northma-American people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The chance that the people who have been talking about is a new belief for me, who had to have the Northans, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the most vulnerable, the Northians need.
After our long journey, my family, and I'm going to get back to South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many North America are separated by their families, and once they get to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
The international community can help us learn in education, to learn English, education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea, because many of us are still in contact with family families, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea.
I had a lucky fortune to get a lot of help and inspiration in my life that I want to be honest in the Northwest of success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot of successful North America in the world, too, at the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a request today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Si is 22, big, very good.
He can't talk, but he's influenced joy in a way that there might be some of the best speakers.
Si knows what love is.
It's just unconditional, and it's going to give them a lot of unliffable.
It's not a nouver. It doesn't stop in the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and she's just telling you, he's never telling a lie.
When he was listening to our songs of our childhood, sometimes I don't remember, he reminded me what we know about the mind and how much we know about the mind and how wonderful it needs to be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good.
He has a absolutely unconditionible memory.
but he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had my chocolate bomber, but he reminded himself that he was writing from every song on my iPod, who we had four years old when he was the first consequence of the paget, and my head-law and Moodas.
Do they not listen to it?
But a lot of people don't want to be right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit in the social version of normal, they're often talking about it, and they're going to understand.
But what my heart encouraged me, and my soul was that, although that was the case, although they weren't as common, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "critism," it's a complex psychiatric disorder, the social communications, the learning and sometimes affect physical abilities.
It's a different part of every single individual, and it's the Sii, it's kind of like Sam.
And the world is going to be found every 20 minutes in a new human psychologist, and although it's one of the fastest growing development of the world, there's no evidence, or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a psychologist, but I can't remember myself without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play how to do the other babies, and actually he didn't really know what he was interested in.
Si lived and he was in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row of cars, to eat everything that came out of him.
And when he became older, he became different, and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger of the rain and the shaman, and that never was a really unique thing: a pure and innocent, a boy who saw the world without doubting someone who never had.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't argue that there were some more challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were exactly like me.
But I go back to the idea of the things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I would not want to cooperate with normality.
So the normality of beauty, the differences that we give us, and the fact that we're different, is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's another kind of thing.
And if I could only tell you about the one thing that I could say to Ji and to you, then it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Everybody has a gift to us. And in all of that, is the pursuit of normality, is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we're trying to be someone else else's disease.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edon has been with us with curiosity and curiosity, and this photo on the project is a apple that's been covered by a period of time and with a half-third.
But now, 50 years later, we're faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the P-to-R-R-R-R-man photographer, a new design technology that's so fast that it can make time-by-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at our perspective or not a <unk>-ray image in our body and really think what we do with "Rommy."
So if I take a laser laser, and I can take it to a 21th-century, and it's a number of extraseconds -- and I'm going to make a piece of photons that's not just a scale of photons and this photot, this project will be able to move faster, and it's going to be a faster than a million times a year.
So if you take this project, this photocel, and we put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
How does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event -- this event.
So, you think that's going to be a lot less than a nanoscopic event -- so long, it takes the light to get that route, but I'm going to get this little video to the 10 billion dollars so you can see the light in the motion.
No, Coca-Cola has not funded this research.
So in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle of a photons that starts moving through and then the inside of that.
One of the light is out of the outside of the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons are finally going to get the drop of the bottle and break into different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's going to be in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table, and because of the angle, you see that the reflection is focused on the end of the bottle after some of the images.
So if you take a more competitive project, and you can take it back the same route, and the video is going to slow back to 10 billion years, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- by a slow, normal project in motion.
And how does it look like a life-time photographer?
You can see the waves of the table, the Tom's, and the wall over the back.
It's like you put a rock in a pond.
And it seemed like the nature would paint this picture, one photo, every single-to-up show, but of course, our eye looks a little bit of a drawing.
But if you look at this Tom's second, you'll see that if the light is going to be dejected to the blue, that's going to be still dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's still in and the light goes around, and after a few seconds, it's coming back.
So in the future, if this Mtoto-R camera is built in your camera, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find if a fruit is a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team have built my camera at MIT?
So when a photographer, you know, when you do a photo with a short-term period, you have very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your short-term period of time, so you get something like nothing like that.
So what we do is we send this project, this is a photocel, a thousand times, and we're looking back and doing it again with very clever processing and doing this 20,000 terabytes of data, to make these things that I've shown you to do this video clip that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and make very interesting things.
So, Panbanisha can fly.
Others can make invisible heroes, but how about a new superpower for a future-o-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-one green network?
The idea is that we're going to put something on the door.
It's going to go to the space, a part of it will come back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use that more of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our F-to-R-R-R camera.
On the wall, a pony is hidden, and we'll let the light down the door.
After our paper in the "Nurce Health Organization," it was released by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to get these light project, and they'll be able to put it back on the wall and get this photons and the photons in all directions, and some of the photons will get our hidden soup, and then then the light will turn the light, and then the tiny piece of the camera will be closer to the tiny, but then they'll get closer to the tiny camera, but they'll get closer to the eyes to the very different, but
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our F-to-R-R camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time to do it, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is looking like.
By looking at a laser, we can take a plastic picture that you see in the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we can bring many of these images, and try to analyze the different light-making, and then we can see the hidden object, and then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our design process.
We have a lot of things to do before we can do this from the lab to practice, we could build cars that are preventing the collisions, and what's behind the curve, or we can look at it in dangerous groups, by looking at light, we can see the bridge, or we can build the back of the bridge, or we can see the back of the body, and we can see the air, and we can see it in the way to the air, and the
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, why is that really a call for scientists, now, thinking about P-to-Dold photography, because a new visualization process of development could actually solve the next generation of medical development.
So as a few seconds of Docillon, even a scientist, is a art of the ultra-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-old photography, and I realized that all of these 20,000 data that we're putting in every time, not only by the scientific image, we can use a new computer-dimensional memory, and we can't look at that time.
But it's happening here, and it's a funny thing.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you see that the waves are coming out of us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What happens here?
It turned out that we're going to take almost in light, weird effects, and Einstein would have heard this picture incredibly.
The sequence of events in the world appear in the back, is going to be in the camera, so by taking the relationship of space and time, we can make that impact.
So whether it's about photography or taking a new visual control for medicine or new collection of development since our invention, we've all made all the data and the details on our website, and hope that the CEO, the professionalists, we should be able to focus on the camera, and we should be able to focus on the next side of the video, and we should start to get to the two-dimensional perspective, and to the next-dimensional perspective of the two-dimensional perspective
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many of the arguments are not being arrested, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and to use things like a little-up, and to use the vops and the circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much pay my neighbors?
How do we let more things without giving ourselves any other?
How can we share our memories on the building, and we can understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being dejected to the giant nour that has been trained for hundreds of years, loved, and pets and vag and vagies. I'm afraid of a city where music has always been.
I think every time someone never had, there's a parat in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the reasons in America.
I have a living in the house, and I thought about how I can do it, and I thought I'm going to change something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved very loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life in the daily lives and forget what really matters.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a side of the house in a giant plate, and I wrote with a rable on the world, and I want to die, I want to say, "I want to take one piece of people who can come back and think about his life and hope about this public.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely broken, and they grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written from the people in the wall.
I want to be mortal."
I want to be hungry, I want to stand at the International Recession line."
I want to sing for millions of people."
I want to plant a tree."
I want to live in the call "I want to live."
I want to keep dying, I want to keep it in my poor."
I want to be a lot of hate, I want to be a guy's Kavavic.
I want to be in my heart.
This was reported to a meaningful place, and the hopes and the dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and so-dough me as the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new way to think about it.
It's about to make place for us and think about what we're most important, while we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of great news stories from the passionate people who wanted to build a wall, so my colleagues and I've been building a building, and now in the world like Madagananan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina, other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public places, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have, time, and the relationships of other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right and think that life is just sensitive and sensitive.
We're often going to talk about death, or only to think about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that we are most protected.
The thought of death is telling us life.
Our common places show us what we're as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities, our hopes, our fears and stories, can be able to help us to help us to help us to help people, to help us to help people better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm talking to you about math. A special problem for everyone who is involved with, with some of the science is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to try to explain what I do.
Together is one of the most human activity.
We're looking at the same thing from the waest ball and the wasters, as you can see.
For the ball, there's an extraordinary amount of evidence and abilities, and perhaps a fundamental sign that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurosological disorders like Parkinson's slow this extraordinary ability. It's also in my pre-downing Janoc, who was a ball of evidence.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to have to have to have the unconditional symptoms like weakness, and the pony, and other people who are living with this disease. So we need to discover the objective of the disease, to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately, the only possibility is to know whether there is cure, if we have an objective effect that can answer this question.
And I think that there's no technology for Parkinson's disease and other movements, so you can't do a simple blood analysis. The best thing is, this 201 NobelD test, for neurosologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that outside clinical studies will never do it.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a pre-old tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't need to be a local hospital.
It's going to be able to study 300 percent in the neurologic field.
So I want to give you a non-exventical method that we're trying to do this, because we're all in some sense, virtual, like my God's Guoculia.
So here's a video of the bright muscles.
This happens in the normal state, if someone's writing, and we can look at the same ballets, because we need to use all these devices, because if we're using the audio, and we've all got the genes for FoxPA.
And as a ball is required a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk about it until they learn.
By looking at the same, we can determine the position of the dopamine receptor, and as the command is also affected by Parkinson's disease.
In the bottom line, you can see an example of the unregular vocalized evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Right, gay, weakness, weaknessy.
The language is even more blind and more aggressive, and that's an example of the neurymon.
This impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital micro-organisms and effecting software, combined with new machine learning that is now very advanced, so we can see where someone is in a human, and with the kind of disease, and only because of the sounds of the sounds.
How can these trials measure these trials with clinical trials? Well, they're not unolocvasive. The test in neurologists.
It's not too much. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are exactly. That's not what's happening with experts.
So you can get done themselves.
They're very fast, take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
This amazing goals can be able to do this.
We can reduce cognitive difficulty for patients.
Patients don't need to make a routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from more active observation.
We can do low-cost mass-scale studies, and first, we can get a study of all the population to make sure.
We've now got the opportunity to look for biomaterials before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start to start to see the Parkinson's disease,
With a parat and patient's Day, we want to take a very high number of voices to have enough data for the challenge.
We have a call-up number of people on this planet are available.
Everybody, without Parkinson's disease, can call cheap enough to leave images for a few cents. I'm talking to joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who isn't you?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the call is told whether that person is suffering in Alzheimer's disease or not.
Some of them might not be able to make it back.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, interesting. These are important because we are in order to figure out what the actual receptor is for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, your 86 percent accuracy is happening?
It's much better.
My students, Ken Thisis -- I have to put it out because he's done this fantastic work -- now, it's also about the cell phone network, which is what this project is required, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a function.
That means that people can call -- people can call the phone, and they can do the test. People could call their voice so that their doctor can read the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southwest of the Chicago Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a little bit more likely to do, and that means that wildlife animals can leave the park at the time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found it dead. It was a terrible thing. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the mass, believes that we came together with our animals and the Netherlands of heaven, and so that means our animals.
I used to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior name is called "The Laans. They protect our tribe and our mouths. They're also involved in this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's a lot of lions in the Nairobi City.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years of his father's father. That's why I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions hate fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions who help to see the cows better.
But I didn't have to go. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to go back to the cow's.
But lions are very smart animals.
You see, the bird's going to go back, and then they go back, but they come back, and they say, the thing is not going to be true, that's still here.
And they take it, and they kill our livestock.
One night I stopped the Stall. I went to the hand with a publet, and then the lions didn't stop.
lions fear of light that moves.
I had a idea.
I used to work as a young boy, and I once took the whole day in my room, and once I took the new radio of my mother apart, and the day she made me almost a lot of electronics.
I took a old car battery, and I took a free driver from a motorcycle, and that shows if you want to go to the right or on the left. It's a bit like that.
And I got a switch to get the lights and to turn the lights.
This is a little black box from a broken box.
And then I built all of them together.
The solar plant is making the battery that takes electricity to the balance. I call it a mixture of a generator.
And the quality of the car is blind.
You see that the lion is looking at the bottom, because there's the lions.
And so this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are slipping and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the Stall. And that's the whole time I'm in bed.
Thank you.
I've been running this to bed, and since we've been doing the problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard of it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of their animals in lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really good.
My idea is used in places in Kenya, also for other predators like hygiene or pats, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from Far.
My invention helped me to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook School School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved, and it helps to deal with donations and education.
I even put my friends home, and we're building the lights there, where there's no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I just got a boy from the savanna who was crying his father. I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a guy."
And here's where I'm here.
I was able to put a plane on my first TED Talk.
When I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to meet lions. But I can save the cows of my father and the lions, and we can do together, on the side of the lions, with no argument.
Elizabeth Ol<unk>n<unk>n. In my language means that. Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on the list?
My next invention, now, I work on a electric fence. A motor deceptive?
Yes, I know, electrical pals are already invented, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, not true -- yes, I've tried to try, but I've been able to get a chance back to that, because I got a stroke.
All right, it's hard. Richard Rose, you're a lot of special.
We're going to be going to hire your boss, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Since I'm old, a camera in the hand is photography. But I want to share with you 15 of my favorite shows, and no one I did.
There was no kind of director, no style, no idea of taking a picture before, not even to get the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were released by random tourists.
My story begins when I was in New York, and my wife made this picture where I gave my daughter to my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and five.
So at the same year, we were back to New York, and so we decided to take the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on?
When my third birthday came closer to my daughter, "Hey, why don't you want to go to New York and do a father's father's husband's brother's brother to get the ritual?"
And then we started asking, we started asking, from the time, to ask, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal vision is when you're having a completely stranger to get his camera.
Nobody has ever said no, and fortunately, nobody has never been with our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very unfinished.
This is only one weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened next day, that one-two-year-old can understand it.
These images are more than just a single moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us to keep at October, the time and over time and how we're going to change our time for year, not just physical, but in everything.
Because when we do all the same picture, it changes our perspective, while they're going to reach new places, I can see the life with their eyes, as they're dealing with everything and how it looks like.
This very stressful time we spend something we're expecting, and we expect every year.
Last, while we went to our travel, we'd always go and suddenly get them out, and they're going to show them on a red bar on a box where they'd learn as a young kid, in front of the university.
And she told me about her feelings that she had at five-year-old at the same point.
She said she was reminded her the heart of her chest when she saw nine years ago the store was first time.
And now she looks in New York schools, because she's really supposed to study in New York.
And I realized that it was clear: The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of taking a active role in the mind of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides those 15 images, I'm not sure I'm in a family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I want to encourage you to get to you today, to come to the picture and ask someone, "Do you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
