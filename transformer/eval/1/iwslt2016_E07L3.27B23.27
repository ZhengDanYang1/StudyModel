When I was 11 years old, I was shocked by the sounds of the sounds of the sound of the sound of the night.
My father heard on his little, white radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at that time, because it was mostly depressed by the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
This morning, I'll never forget.
It's a right school.
The Taliban were tracking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
And so I was so stalled for five years as a boy and I was commelled to my older sister who had not been able to take home to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to guess that nobody could guess where we went.
We're going to put our books in a shopping store so it looks like we'd just go to buy.
We were in a house, about 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of muffed, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
and over and over, the class had to come out for a week, because the Taliban had been listening to it.
We never had any sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to leave us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a lot of lucky fortune to grow up in a family where education was important and female.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- and she was being rejected by his father.
My grand-daughter, but my mother was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, just to turn our home to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first one in his family who ever received a school education.
And it was always clear that his children would get an education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked like a much greater risk to send his children not to school.
I remember that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by our lives, from the constant fear and the interlance of the interruption.
I was really good to give up, but my dad said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be fired from your house.
But one thing will remain your only is that what's in there. And even if we have to pay our blood for your school, we're going to do that.
So -- do you want to give up to me again?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have a higher degree of education than the British degree, and if my family didn't have been used so much for my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proud unconventalary of the Middle Vagina College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was ripped from his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who was compelled me.
He's not just talking to my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the one that runs him through Kabul's car.
My family believes to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
That's why I'm global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women.
And so I helped to build SOLA, the first and maybe the only public public public service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see students in my school with a great ambition to make sure of all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers are going to stand for them, as my parents were, despite me, despite all the rest of the discouraging.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
A month before, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they were the death of a bomb just for a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone ring ringed, and a voice killed him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to leave you now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the future because of your old and pre-replicated ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often being deemed out in the West: the majority of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizing that their success is also its success.
That's not to be called that our mothers don't want to be a important role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are more accurate and compelling to be a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men.
And under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, three million girls in school are beating school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen from America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not about long, and they're changing with the U.S. population.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me to be the hope and the unlimited possibilities, and remember the girls who go to the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, including living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977, I look young, but I'm not -- -- I've -- in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to work with technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every single project that we made on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years ago, we thought that we are brilliant people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which was inspired by the first book of the Zamhhya, was one of the people we wanted to show in Italy about the Sambans, how to grow food.
We came to Italian seed in South Korea, in this slim valley, which leads to Sambesi Flord, and we trained the local citizens to grow the Asian tomato and Pchini.
Of course, the local members had absolutely no interest about it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed to be that there was no such a waste valley in such a plant.
But instead of asking why they didn't build any of them, we just said, "God is so thank you for being here."
"Bouch time in time to save people Sambias from the slime."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-great tomato sauce. In Italy, they were so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambans, "Look, how simple agriculture is."
When the tomato is Day and red, about 200 noders came out of the river and hitch everything.
We said to the Sambors, "Oh God, the pilper!
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were a French writer in Africa so amazing, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French people did. After I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proudly proud about our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the codper.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we didn't have the interceptive African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid Aid" from Dambisa Moyo, she's a paratical economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We have a billion dollars of the world, and we've had a half trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was made.
You're just reading your book.
You're reading from a African woman, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, imperialists, colonialists, mission address, and there are only two species of how we deal with people. We can criticize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root, "bater," which means "sater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I keep every other culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'll keep every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "bood" boss, "Man."
I was shocked when I read the book "Sizicic" by Schumy's singing. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, then they'll let them go to quiet.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Now, the gentleman who opened this conference tomorrow, a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neococic colonial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I invented a system called business management, which never gets to be revented, and you're never going to be able to be able to hire local passion, the local pride, the local man, the dream, have a better person to be.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you're going to put together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafs. We meet ourselves in Kneiph.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friend friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important of humanity.
We help them to find knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with this idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of going into a community and saying what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collectors.
entrepreneurs never have been in, and they'll never be able to say what they want to do with their money, what they're looking for opportunities.
Design has this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We're working one to do that, and we need to be created with social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new profession must be created.
This is the family manager, the family of the business that you're sitting in your house with your kitchen and in the cafeteria, helps you to find the resources to transform your passion in a way that life is going to be able to be able to lead to life.
I tried this in the agality, West Goats, trying to do it.
I've been preparing to go and try to get the shaft of flawy, where we say to others what to do to escape.
And so I walked through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, I helped my first clients. He brought a fish in a garage, he was Maori, and I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then I went to reform, and then the fishermen said, "You've helped me help."
I helped these five fish, working together, not to sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents to 9<unk>Kilo, but to Japan for the Sushi for 15 dollars for Dr.K. and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us."
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and I'll listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Look back again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 50,000 companies in the creation of the organization.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be in loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best-selling workers of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter Turing was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, "Rock is actually unrespuible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christian chass to know what the smartest human Christelel with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to you.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will be distracted.
In a community of 10,000 people, we're getting 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are intelligence and passion?
For what presentation you've ever heard about today?
<unk>""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- un-filling fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there's systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The free-fon of the state is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people into sustainable ways, cure, transport and transport them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Excuse me.
The government? Excuse me!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a scientific magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the future of New York in 180,
In 180, they came together and they were using suspended, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was a holial: New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve, and said, if the population grows in that pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get the people, and it would be impossible to get done with six million horses.
Because they went in the dung.
180, they look the dirty technology that's going to feed life from New York.
What's going on? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology was to make the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearhrish, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered to discourse.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
And next, you have to offer them absolute, passionate services.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all of the things have to do is to sell three things: that must be grandmine, that must be great, and the financial agenda has to be enormous.
So guess what?
We've never met one person who's at the same time, selling and can care about money.
That's not what it doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 ivory companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westyhouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been so important, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 13-year-olds in Northsturland entrepreneurs, and we start teaching students to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransovica. The task is to be the 14th-century students, to support in the first two sides of Richard Bransovovics, how often he uses the word "t" and often, the word as well.
Never again, "D" and 32 times."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where managers have a small Victorian background, sit in cafs and Bars, and your dedicated buddy, who are going to do what someone in this gentleman has done for this guy talking about this subject. Somebody tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, so can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." You know I'm going to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate leadership to help them find the tools and people. We found that the miracle of the local citizens's intelligence will make that the culture and the economy can change only by the passion, the freedom of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice in the wonderful country.
Penn State University asked me -- a CEO of communication -- to collect engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Right. Fear to these students, with their big brains and their big books and their big books, not familiar words.
But as the conversation evolved, he turned me like Alice as she was walking down to the electropleter and watching a door to a completely new world.
And I felt like I was talking to students, and I was amazed about the thought they had, and I wanted to find that other of these miracles in the country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers, the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy and health and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it doesn't understand it. I think it's going to be progressed in our responsibility as non-profientists, that these conversations are about.
But these great conversations don't come out if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles in their wonderful country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit in front of us.
I want to show you some ways of doing it, how you can do it, that we can see the science and technology that you're busy with, sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer to is, what?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only to tell us that their feathers are studying, but also tells us that their feathers, the plastic structure in our bones, because they're important to understand alopalosis and treat.
And if you describe what you do, you'll get away from preventable term.
In English, there's a obstacle to understanding your thoughts.
I'm sure you could use it in a long time and time, but why don't you just say "R" and time," what's much more comfortable for us?
And we think of what we're going to do is to make sense of meaning, not to turn out the same as their level.
As Einstein said, "Tight things are so easy to do this, but not simpler."
You can probably tell you something about your scientific field without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Some things are about to think about this: examples, stories and analogies. And in this way, you can pull us into your mind.
And if you put your work, you'll take the dots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "Eave"?
What happens if someone else's attention? Another one is going to be weeks, and with these dots, you know, your first favorite audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also too much about the spoken work of our brain, and it's very rapidly challenged by it.
This is an example of Genemag Brown, which is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the prosthetic limb was so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffelelel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence, where the audience can even lose the thread, to copy images and graphics that also reuse our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us to open these door and see the miracle country that's going to lead science and technology.
because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to do with the "Nerders in a tight contact, I want to summarize everything with an equation.
And look at your science and your reading, you're going to be able to divide this through the popular, so the audience is important, and multiply the whole thing with your incredible work: and that's what you've done with your incredible work: and that's what you're going to do is that you're going to have to have, what is that are really meaningful interactions that are new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really interested in it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a bank of a cell phone with a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can put a message with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it up on sound clip and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm May of 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city at that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the road and demonstrated them.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're wondering that all these people who have come from and asked change were a cell phone in the bag.
Who's got a cell phone in the room?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost every one of them has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines of information.
Coew data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. will have signed a legal line.
This is called the law enforcement for the Progression.
This is a rule that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service company in all Europe has to store a range of carriers.
Who calls who? Who's sending a email?
Who are you sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is going to be stored for at least six months to two years from your phone companies or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want this protection support.
We want self-driving to the digital age, and we don't want to be able to store the telephone companies and Internet service all of these information from us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were being executed on the streets of Berlin and said, "Funity rather than fear."
And some people even said this could be on Stasi 2.0.
Stye's Stasi was the head-in-in-in-bardi in Eastwestland.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can all this information really store you about?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Igst Tele-Actor, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please send all the information that you've stored on me.
And I asked her once and asked her to come back and I didn't get a right answer. Just even another blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that she's doing it in the protocol.
So I decided to put a court process against them because I wanted to have this information.
But the Deminate Tele-Actor said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to be compared to them.
I'll go back to the post of the show of what they all asked me to do.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. was in the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown shift with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35.830s of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical about what to start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the defenseship.
So with time online and open data City, I've done this.
This is an animation of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can zoom in and go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, to track.
And you can even see, as I walk from Frankmurt to the train to K<unk>n, and how many calls I'm doing on the road.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, it's just like this, I call my wife, and it calls me, and we're talking to each other.
And then some friends call me and they call each other.
And after a while, you call yourself, and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who is going to send a email, all that's possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said, we imagine all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, in their bag.
And the Stasi had known who was in the demonstration of this, and if the Stya had known who were the leaders, would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall might have never happened.
And then, of course, the case of the iceberg of the curtain.
Because today, national agency and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and open.
You want to have the possibility of tracking our lives, and they want to store all the time long termy.
But self-driving and life in digital age is not contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
They need to fight for every day.
So if you go home, you'll tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you say your seniors, only because companies and state people have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to get the information that you've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you need to fight self-driving to the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Central.
This is South Central Central: Spuge shops, rapid restaurants, Brachace.
So the city plan is going to meet and go, to change the name of South Central Central, so it's about something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Spost shops, rapid restaurants, gops, gops.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Rard and the Drivebys.
The comor is that the Driveieie is more likely to kill more people than the Driveyys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles about un-ficial diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than about Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even get that to the people.
And I wondered how you would feel if you had no access to food if you were going out of your house every time you go out of the negative effects that have the total food system on your neighborhood.
I'm able to imagine that slangers bought and sell to use like the transport plant.
I see comedy centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the problem.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have any fun of about about a 15-minute commute to get a apple that's not sub-caced with pesticide.
So I sold a food jet before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park plant park.
It's 45 feet at about five feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to be involved in it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it in the state."
And I decided to keep it in the head.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gride, and we started to grow my food-tower and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a professional group of mine together from all social layers and from all the city, and it's completely voluntary and all we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained to you.
The city came to me and he basically raised me a plan, and said that I need to remove my garden, which was a rung to a masterpiece.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
A transcribe of resources for food prices on a piece of land that doesn't care about you?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her. She's doing this."
Because this time, it wouldn't be going to be.
L.A. Times, L. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city department and a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on Change.org and with 900 regulations we succeeded.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
My townmate even called, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most leads in the United States.
They have 67 miles of traps on the palm.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my motion, I say people that they should grow their own food.
His own food is like to print your own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this pre-visible reality that was made by other people, and I'm going to make my own reality.
Look, I'm an artist.
Communication is my graffiti. I'm going to buy my art.
It's like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to get out of the walls, I'm going to put lawns and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my extraction for these stuff.
You'd be surprised by what the Earth's soil can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine what's amazing about a sunshine, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden to become a instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You would wonder how children are influenced by it.
Stances are the therapeutic and the most cool act that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get strawberries.
I remember this time when this mother came to her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10 to 12:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and I looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't need to do that.
The garden is not the reason to go to the street."
I've been embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only has encouraged me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you don't have scared that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Hum Devil, no, I don't feel so that they're going to be ticking.
And it's about it on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
In another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in D in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to buy the Laster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it has influenced them and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was only for a moment.
Green Gride has already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people in our labmarks, and they were all volunteers.
If kids grow carbon, children eat carbon dioxide.
If they grow tomato, they eat tomato sauce.
But if they didn't get anything from that, if they didn't show how to lose food and body, they eat blind, whatever you're going to be in.
I see young people who want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see little kids who are just on the path that they're looking for, and they don't get anywhere.
I see the hangers as a chance to train these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth's soil, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood block of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship simulator and turn them into a healthy cafe.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comor of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work, and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the pride and honor to be able to build their own food, and if you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to be all environmental foundations, gangmen, gangmen, concerts.
We need to turn the image of windowlights.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to be able to get a pierge, you know?
And let the weapon be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you want to sit in a game and go to a meeting where you're talking about to you, to make some of them cry.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skirts, in my garden so that we can plant some of these pits.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford dictionary is "nollyogary fan."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nnolly-garary" means "non-free politicians."
Although a newspaper editor of a day, a better definition of a headresser said, "A 59 Greygoy is someone who is a foreign doctor, independent of party, or programming, and publishing, and its success by the pure force of the acoustic disregularities."
I have no idea what the memory is.
Something to say, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, the British parliament, were not the same word of debating the debates.
And that was actually going back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was faced with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London and they raamed it, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to fight, and finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "Mree" as well as Brass." Many believe.
Brass is a word for the English of a bar.
But that's not true. It's about a government's freedom of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to the United States when it's just going to be done by independence.
You saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a Dutch nation?
and that's been debated in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of recommendations to make.
I mean, some people wanted to call it to Washington, and others, his Congodoxity, George Washington, and again, the law of the people of the United States, Washington Washington.
Not such a binary.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought that was what was going to be.
They weren't monarchist, they wanted to choose the king for a specific time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was unfinished because this debate took three weeks.
I read the course of a meeting that always writes, "I'll even have the same issue."
The reason for the slipping and the short was that the front door house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good dealer. They didn't want to give it to him.
King calls, and maybe it's going to give it to ideas about it.
They wanted to give him the most powerful, unlanted title that they could find.
This title was "Pory Report."
President. They didn't invent the title. He happened before. But he just meant that someone was going to be a collection of passage.
It's kind of like the pre-nury of a jury.
He had no longer had the equivalent of "The Scise" or "mast water."
Sometimes, there were a handful of protesters of small colonial and government groups, but it was really a misnone title.
And so the Senate refused to give it out.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it president.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign-page license.
Who's going to take it seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come to the Senate.
Instead, you're going to be able to use the word "Chesent," but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not meant because of their honest respect for understanding and civilized nations, whether or in the Republic of monarchy, where it's the state of state of state, that the preservation of preservation, not the preservation of preservation, the president, not the preservation of the preservation of the preservation, the president, the president, the
You can learn three interesting things from that.
One, and I think that's the best -- until now, I can't figure out if the Senate has ever been censed as formal as a president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, the title of the title was just waiting for him to be active.
And second, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary is -- -- you wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States's history of America today is, "Pight of America" is not so humbling, right?
This has to do more than 5,000 nucleic grapes that he has, and the largest economy of the world and a flan drone drone and all this stuff.
But reality and history have given the size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
You have a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the mislusion of self-sess -- now it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear fireheads and so forth.
So at the end of the Senate, the chief and the fore House lost, because nobody feels so humbly, if you're told you're now the president of America's United States.
And that's the most important thing that you can take, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians try to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality of words more than words that might ever change reality.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a Laster with about 50 reporters on the fight to Wallelaltalabad -- a 15-year-old, vegetarian scout from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to put my black Conmarian shoes against a pair of brown leather and crumted a rocket in the way that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before, I was a big war, but next to Pyjama party and football games and training with the Korean and white-American demonstrations that never lived with the community and Afghanistan and Afghanistan, and I had to re-discovered the imagination that I knew was going to be going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing in the South Koreane, Southeast of God's Gardard, and a atheist and a radical political artist who's been living in Afghanistan last nine years, and he's worked.
So in Afghanistan, there's a lot of great things about the art you could do, but I personally don't like to paint raincones. I want to make art compelled by the personality and authority and re-sribed and re-canging reality and even using a kind of imaginary peoples to try to understand the world that we live.
I want to spend a day of an jihad -- "Goyer who calls his jihad against communityists like "Pop-shaped" and used criminal harassment and political corruption to lead.
And what else can be the jihad-man, as the parliament to prepare for, and to make a choice campaign with the phrase, "Don't invite me." I'm jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to let these Mafiosiei, who spend as a national superheroes.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, to the reason that a project called "Rove," where you're going to be a lawyer, a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars and cars, instead of taking paid money from them, to give them money to rent, to the police, and in the name of Kabul, they hope that they will give us 100 percent of them.
I want to look at the conflict in Afghanistan, as I think, became the "Cultural War."
The war and the strange views that came to him have created a new environment for Style and fashion, that you can only capture a fashion-canning for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I put the hives of local Afghan forces with a protective clothing with a protective provocative or a bunch of un-touching untouching a neonialization.
And I'd like to see a simple scarf from Kabul from the Pipling app of 189999 to create a dialogue about the current development of development development development of its origins in the past Colombian rhetoric about the "The Searst of the White House" to have the brown man to even protect it a little bit and even even even even survive.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misuse.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self is worth it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell and for a while, I work as an model.
For 10 years, exactly what I said.
I felt that now, in the room, there's a kind of a unfinished tension, because I wouldn't have to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I've got something to change with it.
This is the first time someone in the TED stage is about to be happy to see that I think.
If some women were really shooked when I came out, you don't need me to say that now, I'll read on Twitter later.
I also find that I'm pretty privileged, because I can make a very short 10 seconds of what you think of.
And that's not the chance for everyone.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the swear over my head, because you'll all be embarrassed, so you're not going to do anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it was not so embarrassing as this picture.
A visual is powerful, but it's also a picture of a super-ficial.
I've just changed your opinion in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to make my back, and with my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrong frines that I've been to do two days ago, there are just a few ways to change our fears, and our expressions -- although it's super-exible and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
To be uncomfortable to be honest to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm an model.
I stand on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was an model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which we're biologically programmed, but as the size of the size, mutant, rap and bright-and-white.
This legacy was created for me. And it's an legacy that's paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionmakers like this, "Halt. Nary, Tyra Sman Sman's Shw. Who is."
And first, I'm commenting your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the distance, each single one that was being dated, and that in 677 square-created microcons were only only only about 27 or less than four percent of them.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I be an model when I am grown?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can be president of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja-bard surgeon, which would be absolutely wrong, because you'd be the first."
If they still say that great extraction, "No, no, Cameron, I want to be an model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird Square, or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
And to say that you want to be an model later, that's like you'd say that once you want to win the Jack Bug in the ser.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of scientific knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be degraded.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is exactly there, like a nice ball, and the customer says, "Camer, we want to run a photo," then we want to start a photo in the first, beautiful, beautiful, hard, so long, that arm goes back to the back, that arm, is going to move on, and you just move back, and you can just see 300 minutes of your friends.
It looks like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finished school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say much more, and if you want to be president of the United States, but you're in life, "10 years of interlance," you'll be curious about it.
The next question that's been asked to me is, "Who's all these photos?"
And yes, all of these photos are being cured, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that's the first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And so I just saw a few months before my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this slide.
My friend had to come to me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shinting for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V-D magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see these pictures are not pictures of mine.
They're constructed, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylylist and Ph.D. pioneers and photographers and Penylists and all their editors and their editors and their practices and their operations. They're not building that.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Am you doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot shoes that I can never wear, but the things I'm going to get free are things I get in real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money. And I gave myself the clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she went over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a say, "Excuse, Mr. Pew, Mr. Pew, and we could go on.
I've paid this free-sense stuff for my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their appearance and not pay for their personality a high price.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenage managers who were in the last year and were filtered, 85 percent of black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 177,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I waiting?"
But, "How many times am I going to stop? When am I going to stop?"
And I found out that in my research, 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent if they were 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model to be?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a bit of thin and thin hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And backside, we give a response to this idea that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never told before is, "I feel uncomfortable."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Did I have happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should be able to meet some modules, because they have the thin legs, and the most beautiful hair and the coolest flam, and they're probably the same because of their appearance, probably, most insecure women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to me to take a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to get here and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile that was so dried to my ass." And it doesn't feel very good to make me happy."
It was particularly difficult to open up a legacy of oppression against gender and race if I'm one of the biggest uses of abuse.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I find it really amazing that I've been here before 10 or 30 years before 10 or 30 years old, and my career was still more comfortable, because I would probably not be told to tell you how my first job I got to say, or I wouldn't be asked, maybe I would have paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our mislived failures and error.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exalinity, "Son, the Gafafafi of Devilion."
But never will be something like a Gafi revolution."
It's been now nearly two years since the Dutch revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass-counds and all in the Egyptian revolution.
I was standing in a lot of other nyans, in and outside, to challenge a day of anger and start a revolution against the tyranny Gadacrosis.
And it was, a big revolution.
Boy, Schbywou women and men in the first row, the end of the regime, gave the final of the authorities, were Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have demonstrated an excellent courage by being put against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far east, to the South.
Finally, after about six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, it made us to free our country and to disengle the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a big home, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannic regime and infrastructure has destroyed the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The destruction and the challenges that I realized, as many other women, have come back to the civil society of Lyas, we asked ourselves to create a certified and un-contitated transition to democracy and state-free.
In 1890, 200 organizations were being launched and immediately after the case Gaddafis in Benghaya, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exilil, I came back to Lyias, and with absolutely broken enthusiasm, I started to organize workhops to the issues of human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Leyier women, a movement of women, leaders of various lives, whose goal is to be public for sociological empowerment to women and to be able to consider our right to the right-being of democracy and peace education.
In the election election, I met a very hard environment, a environment that was more powerful, a community that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and reconciliation.
I led a initiative to the peace platform of Leyier Women to achieve a criminal choice, a law that should give everyone else to vote with whatever citizens should be willing to choose and to fight and to deal with political parties and to a male leader between a broad and a horizontal level to make a difference to make a change on the horizontal and make a change.
At the end of this, our initiative was taken out and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation-class campaign in the first elections since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphemial of elections and the entire revolution was about "The entire revolution," because we were thinking about new news from violence every day.
And we went to the re-counting of ancient mosques and Sufi leaders.
On another morning, we got news about the murder of American ambassador and attack on the message.
And again, another morning, the suicide bombers were signed by the army.
And we really owe the governors of the military and their ongoing participation against the human rights and their prejudance of rules and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary self-organizing, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles of ideals and freedom, dignity, social justice that they were beginning to follow.
Intusion, rejection and revenge were the icon of the era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success of our resurrection and the elections.
In fact, I'm here to admit that we as a nation, have the wrong choices and the wrong choices.
We made our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security in Lyia.
Did the re-excession and the change between female and male leaders and national reconciliation?
No, that's not what it doesn't.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and purpose and both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gard and the fard.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus to be able to lead to the elections that only strengthed the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the more of the female's reproductive embodiment than it takes the numerically, quantitative embodiment of female.
We need to stop talking to the name of the anger and ask one day of the bread.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the gard.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim the values, but also to be honest, or instead of having a hand-fight, to cooperate rather than competition, rather than being re-excessive.
These are the ideals that need a rapt of war to be able to help to get peace.
Because the peace has an alchemie and in this alchemie, it's about the re-exition of the feminist and the ponycades.
That's the real-sensitive.
And we need to do this in general, before we do sociological.
After a de-th-Aed from the Koran, "Salam" -- " Love" "I" "the word of the Good God, "wing."
The word "rarave" again, which is known in all the transcripts of all over the Arab traditions, has the same Arabic as the word "inve" and symbolized the mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother, who's all the female and the female, all the tribes that have come from all.
And just like the mother's neck's neck, which grows in it, completely flows around the underlying of compassion's existence.
And so he said, "My Gard is all about anything."
And so he said, "My Gard's had a pre-diving on my sunt."
Let's all be the art of the Gardard.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're talking about the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan's enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until I could go to a completely changing time.
And I saw a public extension for seven years, but I thought that my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a colleague from a colleague of mine.
And she said, "If you're going to get this up, our five family members will not be more than this in the world because we've had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And I was just over the train, and I looked at something that I couldn't delete myself anymore.
A pried woman on the ground, and a broken child in her arm was so helpless in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because all of them were so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'90, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were in the victims, and many more people have ever survived because they ate grass, and they ate beetles and tree cortex.
Rumcuts were more likely to be more likely to be so that at night, unless the lights of China were on the other side of the fish that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Amhorn, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very scary and enables North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that I was sent to the devastating years of famine to be sent to China.
I just thought that I'd be separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it's about 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be as Northstore refugees. But soon, I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because Northmaan refugees are going to be seen as illegal immigrants in China as foreign immigrants.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would be able to send me into a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and being thrown into the police department.
Somebody was harassing to be North Bronx-law, so they tested my Chinese biases and asked me countless questions.
I had this fear, I thought my heart would explode.
So dignity seems something unnatural, I could be cured and be rejected.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and I answered the questions.
After they finished the question, a citizen member told the other, "That was a false decon.
She's not North Koreore.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans, he's going to post-count in China in foreign messages called the soyl, but many of them are caught by Chinese police and showed up.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they finally were released by massive international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, there are numerous North Koreans in China, and they're being swallowed up to North Korea where they were being re-dested or locked in public or well-discovered.
Although I was lucky with my honor, there's not so many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to struggle hard for survival.
and after they learned a new language, they found work, their world can be put into a moment in your head.
After 10 years of suspended, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started to start a new life.
In South Korea, I was a bigger challenge to leave in South Korea, when I had thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of the inside, we've been very different from the part of it, because of 67 years of the part.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northma-Korean?
Where am I going to come from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the continuity of the southern Asian life didn't get light, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the show of the university.
Just as I was treated my new life, I got a shocked call.
The Northcades of Colombians started the money that I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be a remote place to the country.
They had to be as fast as possible as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to come back with an incredible route to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself back to the North Pacific border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to lead them to more than 2,000 miles through China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus drive took a week, and we've been caught about several times.
One time the bus was thrown up, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all of us and started asking questions.
And my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought she would be arrested.
When the Chinese officials promised my family, I was determined to say that she was a punge, and I was her to be her seminar.
He looked at me in a madness, but fortunately, he believed me.
We managed to go to the far-up border, but I had to take all of my money to be able to get the border from Lama's border.
But even after we've been crossing the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money sentence and cash, my family was released within a month, but shortly after that, my family was replicated in the capital of Lama.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to devote my family to freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested, just before the South Pacific Chapel message.
I went out and forth between the immigrant and the police department, and I tried to free my family, but I had no money to pay for money to raise money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and I explained my situation to my mind, and without being a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I was preparing him from the very heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the Northstan Muslim people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger who had been criticized for me a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately to do so, and he showed me the friend of strangers and support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were all in South Korea, but the freedom is just to get a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and as soon as they come into a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us to learn in education, to learn English, education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us remain in contact with families, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be more successful in North Koreans to succeed with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I just have a request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, big and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he's learning in a way that some of the best speakers might not be told.
Remi knows what love is.
He's going to divide them in unusable, and he's going to divide them in a way that they're being dislaced.
He's not bitter. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences and imagine that he never tells a lie.
When he sang songs from our childhood, words are trying to remember not even once, he reminded me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has absolutely meaningless memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate, but he remembers the papers of every week from every week on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while he was the first episode of the teombet on my arm, and he'd have a lady's birthday.
Don't you listen to it?
But many people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the social version of normal, they're often being over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged and my soul was that, although that was the case, although they were not considered as well, that only could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compism," it's a complex psychiatric disorder of the brain that influenced social communications, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's different in each individual, and it's about Remi's so different than Sam.
And over the world, every 20 minutes of autism is found to be a new person, and even though it's one of the fastest growing development of the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been in autism, but I can't remember myself without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was a lot of a lot of shame.
He didn't want to play the way that the other babies did, and he actually didn't seem to be interested in me.
Remi lived and buried in his own world with its own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row of people, to put the washing machine and eat everything that came from him.
And when he was older, he became different and found the differences.
But behind the anger of anger and the homicities and the never end of hyperactivity was something that was a pretty unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw without any bias, a human being never had.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I go back to the idea of things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
So the normality of beauty that gives us the differences that we are different, is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's another kind of thing to do.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and Sam and you, it would be normal, you wouldn't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in all of us. And in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance to do that is scale, progress and change will die in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edillon's been filled with awe and curiosity with this photo of a project of a apple with a period of war time from just one millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we're not seeing the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you a new kind of photography, the Femto-Rap photographer, a new design technology that's so fast that it can create slow motion photography from light to motion.
And so we can build cameras that look at the outside of our field, or not a <unk>-ray image in your body and really ask what we do with "box."
Now, if I take a laser scan and turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are multiple Femtoseconds -- I'll make a package of photons that are hardly a millimeter wide and this photons, and this particular camera, this project, will move in speed, and I say, how fast a million times faster a project is.
So if you take this project, this photons of cardboard, and you take it into that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the light in slow motion?
So this whole event -- this is the event.
So think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanoscopy -- so long, it takes the light to get that route -- but I'm trying to get this video to 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what's going on.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photons of a camera that starts to move through and then melt inside.
And part of the light is turned out on the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons are ultimately getting the juice of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going to be in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, you can see that the reflection of the fly is focused on some images.
Now if you take a common project and let it go back and slow it back the video to 10 billion years, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little more still-lapse photography?
You can see again, like these waves of the table, that Tom's going to flush the wall over the back.
It's like you're throwing a stone into a pond.
And it seemed like the nature of the picture was able to paint a photo, one of them, but of course, our eye is a mixed image.
But if you look at this Tom's second, you'll see that when the light gets to the Tom's light, that's going to keep moving, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's Day is going to come and the light goes around in it and come back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your camera in your Camerahy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if a fruit is closed without touching them.
So, how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short period of time, you have very little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your shortest period of time, so you're getting pretty much like light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons, this photons of a row, and we're drawing it in a million, and we're going to draw it back to very smart synchronization and combine these gigabytes of data to make these Fto-R video videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So Superman can fly.
Others heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes, can you see from corners?
The idea is that we're going to make some light on the door.
It's going to be re-excading, go into the room, part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually, finally, we could use these more nuanced forms of light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
And behind the wall is a soup of a soup, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the National Communications department, it was made by Nature.com, and they created these animation.
We're going to be able to cut this light project and then they're going to be able to put it in the wall and then be able to put these photons in all directions and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden pars that will break light, and then then then then the door will be able to reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny bit of the photons will come back to the very interesting time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
She has a very good time-solving solution, and she can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
By adding a laser to light, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take a lot of these pictures, dozens of these pictures, and we try to mix them together and try to analyze the different light-making, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got some more to do this before we can do this in the lab, we could build cars that are going to avoid collisions, and see what's on the curve, or we can search on in dangerous circles by looking at light by looking through light, reflected by opening windows, or we can build endow, and we can actually see deep into the body of the skyscopy and see.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, why is this really a plan for scientists to think about F-to-D-D-daughter photography, because a new visual approach could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problem.
So, as Doc Edpton, a scientist, even a few seconds, the science has become a art of ultra-screen photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, not only the scientific processing process, we can create a new form of computer photography, and we can only look at these waves and we can only look at these things, and we can't just look at the waves of the time.
But it's kind of funny about this.
If you look at these waves under the bottles of the bottles, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should be moving to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost in light, strange effects, and Einstein would have seen this picture incredibly.
The order to happen in events in the world is going to be in the camera in a more rapidly sequence, so by doing the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So no matter whether for photography to focus around or create a new representation for medicine or new imaging, since our invention has been able to open up all the data and details on our website and hope that the "bakers, the creative community, the research community, we should be able to stop to start to focus on the pixels and to the next-dimensional representation of the video -- to start to start to start to start to start to start with the pixels, and to start-second
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that our people can improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbor on the street so many of the arguments are not passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors over the last few years, and using things like a pair of ponds and codons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without giving each other?
How can we share our memories on the streets of buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being deflated by the giant naughts that had been so many people who have been in hundreds of years of loved, and I'm sorry about the shadows of shadows. I'm sure about a city where there's always music.
I think every time anyone never had a parade in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most of the rest of the houses in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how to make it happen. And I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody I loved very much.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came out and unexpectedly.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it brought me clarity about things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard to keep that view of every day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a page of the house into a hugeboard, and I wrote a scoop on the gaps: "I want to die," I want to say, " Everybody who's coming from, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and think about his hopes to this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day was completely filled with the wall and grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by people in the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be de-good about piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to be a wider-lipped on the International Space Station."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live in "we"""""" in "bance."
"I'm going to die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I'm going to die, I want to be a guy's mine."
"I'm going to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and rapples and so on the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to create a new and more inclusive way.
It's about changing space for participation and thinking and remembering what's most important, while we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a buildingbox and now in the world like Kasazanan, South Africa, South Asia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to go and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of extractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often being accused of talking about death, or just thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that we are most empowered to.
The idea of death is that life gives us life.
Our common spaces are the best that we are as individuals and citizens, and with more opportunities, we can share our hopes, fears and stories, people can't just help us to create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in a very special problem for anyone who's involved in post-creating mathematics is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you today what I do.
Diver is one of the most human activities.
We're just excited about the face of the poachers of cassett and roders, as you're going to see.
Bouchet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and perhaps a fundamental propulsion that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy these extraordinary ability. It's also what it does with my people in my pre-caccels that was a ballet of humor at his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet there's 6.3 million people who suffer to this disease, and they have to live with the unconditionable symptoms like weaknesses, leats, pishing, and other people who live in the disease, so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only possibility is to know if there's cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
In trouble, if you're in Parkinson's and other movements, there's no biomarkal activity, you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that, outside clinical studies, it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a pre-filling tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't be a expensive hospital worker.
It's cost 300 percent to study in neurologic departments, by the way.
So I want to propose to you a non-conventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all in a certain sense, virtual wireless like my semencillation.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in the healthy state, if someone's written, we can look at as a playful ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs, if we're going to make clay, and we all have the genes for FoxP.
And as ballet requires it to be a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until they learn it.
By looking at the sound, we can determine the position of the vibrating vocal muscles, and as the receiver is also affected by Parkinson's's vocal muscles.
You can see an example of the underlying line of the bottom line, which is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of logical vocal feedback that you see.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Sucency, weakness, revenity.
The language will even be more and more aggressive and more and more, and that's an example of psychymptom for it.
This is a consequence that can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and end-canning software, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now see where someone is in a pubble, where there's a disease between disease and health, just because of the sounds.
How can these tests be measured with clinical trials? Well, they're either non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
That's so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are exactly exactly the same. They're not done by experts.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a very high scale.
These amazing goals can be done now.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data through the current observation.
We can do cheap mass-cost production for clinical studies and first be able to make a research for the entire population.
We've now been able to look for biomarkers for the first time for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start Parkinson's-s-s-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-artization.
With Aalab and patients's DayMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the challenge of this goals.
We have reputation numbers that are more likely to be available to a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, without Parkinson's, can call cheap to leave pictures for a few cents. I'll say that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What do you do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient in the call has to give you a claim to whether that person is suffering in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be able to be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database in different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to be able to figure out what the actual markers for Parkinson's.
At the time, your 86 percent accuracy has to be true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make it a little bit, because he's done so fantastic work -- now showed that it's working on the mobile network, which is what this project allows, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
This is what I call a more improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call the phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's, they could send their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Shaommy, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the mine behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a brain-cetched area in the South, so that means that wildlife can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and she found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only snail.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and our animals from the sky, and so our animals would mean so much.
I learned to hate lions before a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our leaders. They are also being put up for this problem.
and kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's because there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years is responsible for the cows of his father. That's how I was doing it.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that that that would not really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird mask.
I wanted to think that lions thought I was going to go next to the cow's painting.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird scan and go back, and then you get to the next time, and you say, the thing doesn't move, that's still here.
And they take off and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the Stall. I walked around with a papel in your hand and then ran around and then the lions didn't catch up.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
I spent a little boy working all day in my room, and I once took the new radio of my mother, and one day she brought me almost around me. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a direct drive from a motorcycle. This shows you if you want to move to the right or left.
And I put a switch to turn the lights up and turn the lights up.
This is a little mutter from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar bubble creates the battery that provides electricity to the internal power. I call it a composition.
And the right-to-power is glowing.
You can see that the lion's going to be out of the outside, because they come from lions.
And that's what it looks like for lions when they come from.
The lights are going to be glowing and the lions believe that I'm going to go around the rav. And that's what I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been building this in home, and since then we had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped from it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hyena or leopard seals, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to give a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helping with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we installed the lights there where there's no one, and I'll show people how to use them.
I only took a boy from the savanna who was crying his dad's village. I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a room."
And here I am here.
I was allowed to share with an airplane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to be a lion. But by my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and we can do it together, on the side, with the lions, without the arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>nn. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know what's interesting to hear a story like your own.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on the list?
My next invention, now, I work on an electric fence. A electrodeable?
Yes, I know electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, not true -- yeah, I've tried to do it, but I've been able to give you a chance to get a little bit back, because I got a cut.
All right, Richard Turder, you're quite special.
We're going to be going to feed you on every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Since I was old enough to keep a camera in your hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and no one of them I've done.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way to shoot a picture. Not even be used to be calculated.
To be honest, most of you were shot by random tours.
My story starts when I was a talk to New York, and my wife made this picture that I gave my daughter to her first birthday. We were on the corner of 57th and five.
And so last year, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see what's going on ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you want Sabina to New York and do it a father's grandmother to continue to move the rituals?"
And then we started asking tour tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, if you're a completely stranger, your camera is enough to do.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody else is never going to give you a camera.
and we didn't know how much of these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a handful of a sudden, or a specific journey.
They're also a possibility for us to be a week in October, to keep the time and change our time from year to year to year, not just physically, but in all, in all, in particular.
Because even though we do the same image, our perspective of time changes, while they get new pieces of pieces, I can see the life with their eyes, as they deal with everything and how they see it.
These very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we appreciate and expect every year.
Lastly, while one of our travel, we walked a walk, and suddenly they stayed like it, and it shows a red brand on a dollet that she had learned as a little kid, in earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had thought of as five-year-old in that place.
She said she remembers her being in the heart of her chest when she saw nine years ago the store for the first time.
And now she looks in New York to high schools because she's really trying to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing that we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious form of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides these 15 pictures, I'm not in a small family photo.
I'm always the one that makes this picture.
I want to encourage everyone of you today to come into this image and not ask someone to ask, "Would you want to make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 23.27, 54.5/30.4/18.0/10.9 (BP=0.974, ration=0.975)
