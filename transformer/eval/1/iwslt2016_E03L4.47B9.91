When I was seven years old, I was a day from the most of the fear of the shock.
My father knew about her little, beautiful, beautiful-dold video, the message on the website.
He looked very happy to know what was pretty unusual, because it was the news of the most popular.
He called "The World War."
I didn't know what was the idea, but it was really obvious, very, very, very happy.
"I'll go to a real school." He said.
This morning, I'm not sure.
A real school.
The FBI's law of the power in Afghanistan, when I was six, and they were killed school.
So I was going to be a couple of years ago, and I was a young boy, and I was not going to go to school, not to get a message to school.
Only we could go to school.
Every day we had a way to know, no one could happen where we went.
We're going to go to our books with the books, so we'd just go to the same.
We were in a house, we were going to go to 10 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a really, but it was pretty cold.
We knew that we were all the lives: teachers, teachers, and our parents.
After all, the students had to go out to the school, because the FBI had the first thing to do.
We were not sure how much they knew.
Are we going to be?
Did we know where we live?
We had fear, but we wanted to go home.
I had a great family to go into education, and I had been learned as important as the students and colleagues.
My grandfather was just a very far time.
A pant from a war in the prison, he was in the prison, he was to send my daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- and he was to send him to school and he was going to go to her father.
But my mother was a teenager.
It's it.
A couple of years ago, they went to the house, just to get our house for a school and women from the streets.
And my father -- I think -- the first person in his family, who had ever been a school.
And it was really important to get his kids to get a partner, even their mother, despite the police, despite all the animals.
It looked like a bigger risk of their kids, not to send their kids to school.
I know that I was still afraid about the first of our first soldiers, and sometimes the worst of our life, the fear of the fear and the fear of the fear.
I had to be good, and my father said, "I want to listen to your boss. You can lose your life.
You can buy money. You can be used to be killed by the war.
But one thing is, you're going to get, what's on here, and when we're going to buy your blood for your own school for your own school, we're going to get to buy it.
So -- you're going to ask me?"
Today I'm seven years old.
I grew up in a country that was used by the war of the years.
More than half of my women have been a bigger age of the prison, and when my family didn't have been so much successful for my family, I would have been able to have been a lot of women.
Instead of this is what I'm going to do here is when I'm a little bit of the New Yorker.
When I went to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was the father who was sent to her family, because he was a message to send his colleagues to school to send his mother to the first one.
He's not just a student with my university, but also I was the first woman, and the first woman was to go through the car with the car.
My family believe me.
I have big dreams, but my family has always more dreams for me.
So I'm a global campaign for 1064 to a global campaign for women.
So I learned to build CD.D. and maybe the first school in Afghanistan, and maybe a country in school, who is still a country for girls.
It's wonderful to see the students in my school with a very successful, very successful, and they want to find them all the skills.
And as they look at their parents and parents, as they were a secret, as my parents, and even as I was going to be able to get the same thing.
So as a professor. It's not the name, and I can't show the face of the father, but the father is a student of my students.
In a month, he was a month, and he was on the home of the village in the village, and they're from the death of the death of the street, just a few minutes.
When he went home, the phone and a voice and a voice, if he was going to go back to school, he would try to go back to school, and she would try to try it.
He said, "I'm going to go to my own, but I don't want to go to the future of my daughter's book to the future of my daughter and the most popular ideas."
What happened to Afghanistan, I realized something that is the West, and often, the most of us, who have a father who has a father who is the father, and that's the fact that his father is that it's not the success.
It's not the reason that our mothers don't have a important role in our success.
They're also often who are looking at the same way, and they're more likely to be a very successful, and they're a very successful list of their colleagues, but in a society, like the women who are not afraid of the poor.
The first woman went to school, and it was a few girls for school -- because it was not illegal.
But now, in Afghanistan, we're going to take three million girls on school.
In Afghanistan, it seems to be from America, like this.
The American Americans see how the changes are.
I'm sure the change of the scale is not about the end of the U.S.S.S.
But when I was in Afghanistan, when I look at school, and I see the teachers who are able to learn their parents, they're able to learn them to be a very, and I'm a very honest change.
In Afghanistan, I'm interested on a country and the most important possibilities, and I remember myself remember the day, the girl who went to the Christmas.
It's like, I've got them to love great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, I mean, I mean, I mean, my life was used from seven years old, and I've been a young man in Africa.
In 1967, I see, I'm young, but I don't know -- -- I'm -- -- I'm not -- in California, in California, California, California, and in the University of science, and science work with the world.
I worked for a French project, and every single project that we found the legs in the legs.
I was really hard.
I thought that we were a good people in Brazil and good work in Africa.
Instead of us were killed what we did.
Our first project, what my first book was, "The S<unk>ampy, was a journalist, who was a journalist, who was trying to show the people in the war, how to do food.
We went to the French-American-American in South Bronx, and we started to put this into the S<unk>C. and we used to have the local government, and we used the government of the European Union and the European Union and the Chinese and the Chinese and the Chinese and the war.
Of course, the local community had no interest, so we were willing to do it for the work, and sometimes they were still looking at it.
We were excited that it was in a way of the natural Europe, there was no natural Europe.
But instead of thinking why they're not a bit of them, we're just saying, "Oh, we're sure we're here."
"Take" in time, people who are going to save the law of the guerrillas."
Of course, all of us, it's wonderful in Africa.
We had these un-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Tad, how fast it's called the system."
When the fire and the fish were there, about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about 12 degrees of the river and all.
We said, "Oh, God, the poue, the mumble.
And they said, "Yes, we don't have a crisis here."
Why did you say that?" "You never told us."
I thought we were a lot of great, and then I saw the American, and then I saw what the American war was doing. The English, what I saw was, what I did was not really excited about in the New York.
We're just going to go to the pic.
You should see the weather -- you should see the weather that we have no longer been able to have the most African people.
They should read the book of "The Aiiiiiiiii, she's a neurististististist.
The book was published in 1993,
We have a major-century largest-century year in the last decade.
I'm not going to tell you what money has done.
Just to listen to her book.
Let me tell you about a American, which is what we've got.
We're human beings, neurologists, and there are only two species like we're using people, and we're using people like people with people. We're not a non-re-re-re-f-food-food.
Both words from the Arab, which means "Jeopardy" means "Jeopardy".
But they have two different things.
I mean, I'm a lot of media than any culture, as I'd like my kids. I love my kids. I love.
In fact, I'm a lot of media, as a culture, as I'd be the French.
So we're going to say, the white people in Africa, "Jeopardy, the boss.
I was a bit of, as I was to read the book of "Jeopardy", and he said, "I know, in the state of the medical crisis, even if you don't want to help people.
So this should be the first help.
The first thing is to be creative.
Now, I'd got to go to the movie, the conference, a place on the ground, and then I asked you, "Do you imagine a city, you know, the kind of unconcigicist, the non-tatistist?
When I was a young years old, I decided to get people to get a system, and we had a system called a system, and you never never never never never never have a chance to be able to be a leader, but you're not going to be a family, the family of the family, the poor of the family.
What you do -- you're going to get the mouth.
You never have a community with ideas, you're going to get a secret of the gang.
We don't work from the lab.
We're going to take us in the TV. We're going to take us in a little bit of p.
We don't have a infrastructure.
We're going to look at friends and find what the person wants to want.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make a idea of a idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The main growth for the person is the most important thing.
The main thing for the head is the most important part of the human history.
We help them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person with the idea of the idea, it's not the knowledge, but it's all available.
I had a study, why did you want to go to a community, and to say, how do we want to hear what they do? Why don't we want to hear them in the community?
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community-based community.
They never have a leader, and they're never going to say what they want to do with money with their money, what they're doing.
So, you know, this is a little bit of the ball.
The most of the people who don't know, because they never just get to the public work.
We work to do one to do this, we have to have to be a social systems that don't have to be a social infrastructure.
A new job has to be built.
This is the house of the hospital, the house of the house, who is in your house, with your house, and you can also find your work in the table, and you can find a sense of the community.
I did this in the vist, the West, to try to work.
I was a while of time, and I tried to be able to say where we say other things, what they do?
And so I went to the first year, and I had the first three days of my students, and I went to the first day. He was a restaurant, and he was a restaurant, and he was a restaurant, and he was a restaurant, and he said, "You know, I gave him to buy a restaurant, and we said, "You'd help them to help them to help them."
I've been going to work to these five,000 fish, and we're not going to buy this wonderful box in a train for a car to buy a bomb for 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 15,000 dollars, but then they said, "You know, and they're going to help them."
In a year, I had four projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I do something very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
I feel the mouth and I hear them."
So -- -- so, the government says, "T, let's go back."
We did it in the world in 300 communities.
We've been able to have about 500 companies in the study.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to be in the depression.
Bob's name, one of the best artists of history, died with six years ago.
Bob was a journalist, before he started to study companies. Bob wrote, "I think, in a natural context, is a political and economic society."
So the war is the death of the leadership of leadership.
So you're going to go to a pant, not to know what the most human person's human man's human and to do with money.
You need to learn how to make it up.
You have to help them and privacy. You have to help them to help them, and they're going to be honest, and they're going to be able to be honest.
In a community of 10 people, we're going to give them 30,000 soldiers.
Can you imagine a community of thousands of people who think language and creativity?
What do you have to do with the talk of you? Right?
<unk>uite lucky, people. They're going to be a little bit of.
I want to say that leadership is the right way.
We're the first revolution of the first revolution -- the informal systems, and suddenly, there's systems, and suddenly there are no systems that are not available.
The law of the self-esteem is not a problem.
The S<unk>aeda of the public is not a problem.
We need to look at the way we can use five billion people to use energy, and use them to use them, and they can use them to use them.
The technologies don't exist.
Who will be the technology for the green revolution? You're going to ask you?
The government? You know!
It's a leadership. And they're doing it now.
I read a scientific story in a scientific scientific research for years ago.
There was a group of experts who were asked to teach the future of the New York City in the New York.
In 1967, they started together, and they were going to go back to 30 years ago, which was a really popular event. The city was not a year.
Why? You saw the mountain and said if the population was growing in this area, they needed to get six million legs to get the people to get a little bit of money, and it would be impossible to be a half of the fish.
Because they went to the cold.
In 1967, they're the cold technology that's going to be on from New York City.
What happens? In the United years, when we had 10 dollars in the United States, 10 dollars -- 10 dollars.
The idea of technology was to find a different technology. There were little trees in the streets.
And I'm a, Mr. Teszler. Adam Smith.
There's a secret to work with people.
The first thing we have to be to be a secret.
They're not talking about you, and they're talking to you.
So the next thing you have to do is they have to help them, and they're creative to help.
And then you have to tell them the real truth about the leadership.
From the most of the most recent company, we have to buy three things: The product needs to sell the product, the free-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
Do you think?
We never had a single person who can buy something that could buy something, and they can afford to get the money.
So something doesn't mean.
This person was never born.
We've been working research, and we've looked at the most of the world -- the World Park, the C.S., the new companies, the new companies, Google,
There's only a thing that all the successful companies have had a very, only one of the people, not only a person.
Now we teach our 15-year-old students in San Arabia, and we start to start to ask them the first two letters from John Snowden, and they're going to give the first question of the first two-year-old book, and the first thing that he call "The Nobel Yorker" and often as often as well as well as a word.
No, and it's about 12 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody had a company. No.
So we can create a community that's a little-time world, and you're going to go to the TV, and you're going to go to the email, and you're going to go to the guy who's going to say, "You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to be going to be a question about this.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can buy it? Can you get the money?
"Oh, no, I can't say, "I'm sure I'm going to think I'm thinking about somebody?"
We're using communities.
We have groups of leaders who are allowed to help the organization, to help them learn the laws and help people, and we found that the government of the government, and we found that the government can be able to change the political system and the community, and that the community can be able to be the relationship to be the relationship of the social and the social and the social of the social.
Thank you.
For five years ago, I have to think how to be the first question in the war.
The University of London, I asked a call for a "D-based design -- for students to create the business.
I had scared --
All right. They were afraid of their students with their big brains and their big books and their great books, not to say, "Jeopardy."
But as the conversation, he started to come out to me, and when he looked back to the back and send a bridge and to a new world.
I felt like a while I was working with students. I was excited about the idea that they wanted to know, and they wanted to know that other thought that there was other evidence.
I think that's the door to go to the door, it's a great design.
We need to really have great communication and scientists to change the world.
Because our scientists and scientists are the biggest problems that we're doing, like energy, health, and health, and when we don't know it, and we don't know it, and we don't know why it's not the leadership of our success.
But these wonderful things don't happen when our scientists and scientists don't want to teach us in their own class.
So scientists and scientists, please, come up to us.
I want you to show you a couple of ways of how you can see that we can see the science and science and science, and the science that you're really excited.
The first question that you're going to ask us is, right?
And let's tell us why you're just a scientific area of what's really important for us.
And we don't just realize that their stress is, but also, we're also saying that they're going to look at the color of the memory, because they're also going to understand how important and not to understand it, and we can understand it, and we can't understand it.
And if you look at what it does, then you do, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
There's a result of understanding your mind.
I think they could use their own and more, but why not just say, "Jeopardy," and what's going to happen with us?"
We're going to make sense of the idea, it's not the same way to go back to the way to the same way.
As Darwin said, "Tall", the things like this, but not simple, but not simple.
You can tell you about your scientific culture, without a way to get rid of the non-esteem.
A few things are to think about, examples, stories and memory, and memory, and memory, in your way, can you follow in your heads.
And if you go to your work, then you go out of the lines.
Have you ever asked me why it's the "cist?"
What happens when someone comes to? A different, and then you're going to get two dots with your audience.
A picture of this is not just fun, but also to talk to the part of our brain, and then we're really excited about it.
Now, this example of neurosii, it's a lot of effective, and you show that the visual structure is so powerful, it's also the fact that the idea of the design of the design of the design.
The trick is, a single sentence, just to use the audience, to even even even even the audience, even if you can even get the same, and then the images, and then the other way that it's going to be the way that it's going to be the way to be the way that it's the way that's the way that's the way that's the way that's the way to do.
These are just a couple of things that can help us to see this door and see the question that science and science and science and science.
There's the researchers I learned to help me to try to make myself feel with the "The World" in the very specific way I want to do with this image.
And you look at science and your favorite hand, and you're going to say, this is the audience, and what's the best thing that's going to be, and what's the conversation that's going to do with your work is that you're going to have a lot of new, and you're going to have a lot of these new personal skills.
So scientists and scientists, if you did this image, you know, I've ever been interested on.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell.
A cell can change a body and change a personal identity.
So you can read a phone of the human development in the U.S. to write in the public.
So you can start a phone and you can start a secret and start in Egypt.
And with a phone, you can take a song, it's called a little bit of the text and the name.
All of this is a phone.
I'm a year in London and I live in London.
Let's go back to this time in this city.
You can see how many people went to the street and then went to the street.
We're in the Southwest, and we've got to think that all these people who had to go to the environment and then ask a phone, a phone in the phone.
Who has a phone in the room?
You're going to look at it.
You're going to take your cell phone, you're going to go!
You're going to go up. A email, a toy, OK.
These are many. There's no phone.
But I want to talk about my phone and my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is about 12622222.
C-s-s-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-
And why is this information?
Because in the summer of the C.S.S. has a complete place.
This is the essence of the law of the war-tath-tath-tath-tath-town.
The key thing is that every car-based company in Europe, every Internet, has to build a huge amount of industrial and a huge amount of industrial waste.
Who's going to be the who's going to be a email?
Who's going to be a message?
And if you use a phone, where you're.
All of these information will be used for six months to your phone or your iPhone or your Internet.
And everywhere, people have come out in Europe, and they said, "We don't want to go."
They said, we want to be able to be a non-cigate.
We want to be a self-term in the digital age, and we don't want to make the patients's car-making and the Internet and the Internet and the Internet, we need to do all of these information.
There were a journalist, who said, who said, "We don't want to go."
And here you can see how many people were in the streets of London, and they said, "Well, "wood" as bad."
And some of them said that it could be called the PD.S.
The S<unk>S. was the S<unk>niiiiii in the South Bronx.
And I'm also wondering how that's really working.
Can we really do all this information about us?
Every time I use my phone?
So I asked my phone phone, the first car, the first car in Germany, and I asked them, and I asked you, I asked all the information that you've got to come to me.
And I asked them, and she said, "Well, no answer was just the right. It's just a little bit of the p.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life, because it's the way to do it.
So I decided to make a bomb for a long-citting, because I wanted to have to have the information.
But the S<unk>aeda said, no, no, we're not going to give you the information.
And then it was a bit of them.
I'll go back to the end of what they all did.
Because in the end of the first time, the international government decided to do that the app was the Great boson was the real law of the Great War.
So I got this cold-in-in-in-up to a song.
And the S<unk>S. That's the guy.
Four6 degrees of information.
First, I saw it, and I said, it's good, it's a huge quote. I'm going to go to my own.
But then I realized that I was a while ago, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this event.
So I was a little bit of thinking what I'd like to do?
Because you see where I'm in night, where I'm going to go to bed.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called the law of the war.
So I've done with online and data, so I've done this.
This is a tool of six months of my life.
You can go up and go back and go back and go back and go back.
You can do each step, I'll do it.
And you can see how I'd go to the train of Purt, and how many of the phone I do.
All of this is possible to do this information.
It's a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, it's just the way I'm going to call my wife and she's going to talk to me and talk to a couple of time.
And then I'll give you a couple of friends and they're going to go to each other.
And after a while, you're going to go to you and you're going to go to them and we've got this huge systems.
But you can see how people learn with each time they call them to go home.
You can see everything.
You can see the largest dots, who are the leaders.
If you have to find that information, you can see what society does.
If you have to have to get information, you can control the society.
This is a building for countries like China and the war.
This is the perfect design, as you can have a society, because you know who's talking about who's talking to a email, who is the way you can do that information is possible.
And this information is going to be used for six months ago to Europe, to be two years ago.
As I said, we said that all these people in the streets in the streets in the streets of the streets were in their own phone.
And the S<unk>ueen had said who was in the end of the experiment, and when the guerrillas were the leaders who were supposed to have been heard what the leaders were.
The case of the museum, the museum could not have been done.
And yet, the case of the cold-up and the mountain.
Because today, we want to use the international and companies so many information to use them how they can go from, and we can go back and go and go and go and go.
You want to make the opportunity to make our lives, and they want to do everything long.
But even a life and a life in the digital age, it's not a failure.
But you have to fight the self-esteem today today.
You have to fight it every day.
So if you go home, you say, you say, you're going to say, your friends, that's a legal part of the 21st century, and that's not the old.
If you go home, you're not only a company, because we have the government and the opportunity to use the potential, to use the way that you have to use the information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone phone phone to get the information that you've got to do.
So in the future, every time you use your phone, you remember that you have to fight your own self-time self-time,
Thank you.
I live in San Diego in San Diego.
This is South Carolina: Polas, open, open, open, open, open, open.
So the city of the city, and then the name of the name, is to change the name of the West, so it's a different thing to change it, how it's going to happen in the city.
This is San Francisco.
Tumble, open, open, open, open, open, open.
So as a half-year-old American American American American, I live in the high school, the home, the home of the home and the S<unk>aeda.
The real thing is that the Dr.S. people eat more people than the Dr.S.
People are dying in San Francisco in San Francisco.
The economic state of my hometown is a five times more than the S<unk>aeda, which is about about about about about about about 12 miles.
I couldn't have to have more of them.
And I asked myself how you were going to have no money, if you had to have no money, if you go to the house, you're going to go to the same thing that you're going to see, the informal system of the local system.
I'd like to kill you that I'd be killed and we'd be able to sell the use of the drone.
I see a picid, I see the vars, like the Microsoft.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I realized the solution is the solution.
The problem is food and food is the solution.
And I had no idea of a little bit of a little bit of a car to get a call a call, not to get a call, not with the uncigilial,
So I went to a food school for my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's about three feet.
The thing is, it's the city of the city.
But you have to do it.
So I think, "D. I can do what I do, because I want to be to be the responsibility and I have to be in the way."
And I decided to make it like this.
So I started and I started the group, the G.S. and we started to start together, and we started to go to the food, and they started to send the whole software, and then they were the whole,
We're a kind of kind of-based, together from all the different worlds of the city and all the entire city, and it's completely hard, and everything we do.
And the kitchen is beautiful.
But then someone else else else.
The city came out and he was a very clear, and I said that I had to have to have to open my air, and I have to have to be able to get the air of the slime mold,
And I thought, "Well, really, right?
A set of unconcigined, from food, in a piece of food, the place that you don't have to be in a place?
And I thought, "T. I thought that."
Because it would be not to go back.
The C.S.S. Teszler had a story. I started to talk about the city and talked to a bank with a bank, and she was a bank of a bank, and she was a meeting for a bomb, and we were not successful for a month.
We thought we were the war in the hands.
My city was actually called, and they said they're helping them learn and love what we do.
So why did they do that?
<unk>S.<unk>S.<unk>. In the United States, the most of the most of the people in the city.
They're going to put a hundred miles of the Golas.
This is about 20 South Park.
This is enough to reduce 12 million weapons of plants.
Why should they find that? Right?
And by the way, you take a fly of a fly, a half-dollar fish.
With green flies in the power of a dollar, you're going to take soap and eat them in the risk of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost.
It's my boss, I'm saying people who are going to be able to save their own food.
His own food is like to fly their own money.
You see, I've been a leader in San Diego in the South Valley.
I grew up there. I grew my colleagues up there.
And I'm also interested on this part of the real reality that I've been used to be used to be used by other people and I'm going to be able to be able to be the reality.
You see, I'm a designer.
My work is my brother. I'm going to put my art art.
It's like a blog designer, the walls, the walls, and I've got to go to the streets and the park.
I use the air, the Earth, the way to create a piece of the plants and the plants are the animals, and the animals are the way I do with this.
They would be surprised what the Earth can do, if you can use it through the fly.
You can't imagine how interesting is a blue, and how they're looking at people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my own office for a tool for education and the community of my own community.
To change the community, you have to change the effects of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be asked by how kids are going to be used.
In the middle, the most powerful and the most, you can do, especially in the city.
And then you're going to get more.
I remember this time when these mother came out of her mother and her daughter came out of 10 days. She was about my office. She was on my office, and she looked like.
I felt bad, because they were there, and I said, "You don't have to do it, you don't have to do it.
The street is not a reason to go to the street."
I've been able to look at people who were so happy and they were so happy and they were always, and I've always been able to do it, and I'd like to do that, "You know, you're not afraid of the money."
And I said, "Lah, no, no, I don't know that they're afraid of what they're doing.
And this is what's going on to the street.
But this is the idea.
I want you to do it, but at the same time I want to go back to the health."
And I took a window in this room in this man in the prison, and I put a street in the S<unk>.S.
These are the guys who taught me to get the pets.
It was cool, and they were doing stories like it, and how they're going to be, and they were able to have their mother and her mother and her mother, and they were really excited how they changed it, and it's not just a moment.
Colas has been done about about about about about about 20 degrees of food.
And we started to put our online people all over the 50 people, and they were all the time.
If kids eat, kids eat.
If they're not going to eat the weapons, they eat the food.
But if they're not going to get it, if they're not going to see the power and the body and the body, they're going to eat what they're doing.
I think young people who want to work, but they're looking at this thing -- I see the same kids who are in the same way that they're not going to be, and they're not going to be there.
The way I think of the people, as a chance, we can help these kids to help them to help them to help their communities to create a more effective life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could use the next Mary C.D.
But if we don't change the scale of the Earth, we're never going to change.
So this is one of my research. I want to do.
I want to share a whole city of the streets where people can share the food in the same way.
I want to take the fly and make it into the food.
So you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about food, because it's not a cost of food.
The actual thing about science is that you have to be able to be able to be involved.
I'm going to talk about people, and kids from the streets, and they're trying to get the fear and the fear of the fear and the fear of the fear, and the fear of the fear, when you're going to build food, and you're going to build food.
So what I want to do here is that's the wrong thing.
I want you to be able to be all the weather, the first, the guerrillas, the guerrillas.
We have to go through the image of the mountain.
If you're not a man, you're not a p.
You're going to get to a pagy, right?
And let's take the gun of your choice.
If you want to go to me, you don't want to go to me, if you want to go to the conversation and you want to go to the website, and you want to talk to you to go to the conversation.
If you want to go to your hand, you can take a little bit of the air, and we can actually take some of them in my backyard.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite favorite in New Yorker is "The English" is "The S<unk>inan."
Because it sounds like this.
And "want" is called "cood""-cood-esteem of leadership."
Even though a student of the 19th century, a better definition: "The Moyy, somebody who is a leader of a leader, or a leader, or his mission, and his success, and his uncumbleion, and its uncantity of the state of the state of the state of the state of the unth-cantity of the state of the state-tath-tath-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
I don't have a idea of what the "Jeopardy" is.
I think I think I think I think, I think, I think, I think,
But it's important to say that words in the state of politics, and all the people know that they need to do to control language.
In 1967, for example, the American government had been released, not the same word of the word of the S<unk>aeda.
And that's what the man was going to go back to the man with the amazing name of the guerrilla, who was working with the war.
They were going to go to the University of London and she was a man, but he was hard enough to get it, and he had enough to get it, and then he had a lot of money in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first sentence for the "The Nobel Prize" as much as a lot of people.
And then, in the word of the word of the word, the word of the word.
But that's not true. It's going to go back to the original law of the war.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you to take up in the United States, and I want to take you to take you to the war, as it's actually been the war.
You saw the question of how to call Microsoft, the state of the state, the state should be called.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leaders of the American state?
In the case, it's been used to be a long-term,
And there were all sorts of things that had been able to do.
I want to call some people to call the Internet, and other men, and then, and then, and then, the way that the government of the government of America,
It's not a kind of cool.
Some people wanted to call him the French.
They thought that's the case.
They were not a non-esteem, they wanted to give the king for a certain time.
It could work.
But every one was unacted, because this idea was a three weeks ago.
I read the book of a blog, the whole thing that's going to say, "I've got the same thing."
The reason for the end of the end, and the job was that the war was the first thing to be the war of the war.
The original bomb was not to say that Washington is going to be a bit of it. They wanted to go.
The king call, and it might be even to get ideas on his own.
They wanted to give him the worst, the most famous name that they're going to give.
This is the title of "The Great Life."
The president. They didn't have the name. He was actually done. But he realized that someone was going to be a conversation to be a conversation.
So something like a p.D.
He didn't have a bigger size than the "Jeopardy" or "Jeopardy" or "cood" or "dit."
Sometimes there were a group of leadership and government companies, but it was really a really unconcantist.
So the thing was, the pail was going to go.
They said, "This is funny, you can't call him the president.
This guy has to be able to get out of the guerrillas and the guerrillas.
Who will take it a little quote like a little quote called the United States's American of America?"
And also after three weeks ago, the S<unk>aeda didn't go to the end.
Instead of the language, we don't want to use the "The name"", but they wanted to make sure they were not really clear, they were not because they were not the political, and the government of the government, or the government, not to be the American of the American, and the American of the American, not to be the human government.
You can learn three things.
First, and I think that's the best thing -- I don't know if the British was the first sentence of the first sentence.
Robert Luther Luther, who said, he's just the name of the name. He's just going to be the end of the law.
Second, you can learn that a government is something that's a kind of a little bit of a thing -- you're going to go to 12 years ago.
Third, and that's important, the most important thing is that the National World War of America is not so bad for America, right?
This has been a little bit of the more, more like, more, more, and the largest world has the largest and the largest world and the world and the whole thing that all these stuff.
And the truth of the Big Bang has been the size.
And so this is the S<unk>S.
They're a secret.
And the other thing that's the kind of wonder is the self-esteem of self-esteem -- and now it was like this.
But you know how many countries have a president?
In 1964.
Because they want to be the guy like the guy with the high-t-downed-t-town-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
So the end of the end, the end of the war had lost, because nobody feels wrong, if you're going to say, the president is the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can do with you, and I'm going to leave myself.
Now, teachers try to use the reality and change the reality, but the reality changed the reality, but also the reality of other words, as much as a matter of the reality.
Thank you.
So I started to go to a po with about 10 to 10 to the war, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a, a, from Watson.
I could see my black-year-old parsed, and a couple of cars and a pars and a dinned, and a mountain in the state of the government, I couldn't see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was long before I was a big war, but after the war, I was going to write up to write and write the email and write with the guerrillas and the European Union and the French and the French and the war, and I knew that I didn't know, I knew that I had to have to be able to be able to be able to be a war and I had to have to have to have to be in the war.
But this is the weather of self-esteem.
And so I'm here, I'm a great, South Africa, from the French, the French, and a cultural artist, and a cultural artist, and a huge artist, and a huge artist, and the last 20 years, and it worked.
So, there's a lot of things in Afghanistan, and you could do not like the art, but I don't want to play the bread, and I want to make the fear of the fear and the fear of the fear and the way that we're trying to understand the real and to understand the world.
I want to spend a day of a public, and I want to spend the freedom of the leadership of the leadership of the leadership of the "cant and civilized and political and political and political.
And what else can do is the law of the war as a leader for the international government and a partner to make a choice with the "Jeopardy" and I'm going to make you, "I'm going to be rich."
And we try to use this campaign to make these Miiiii, who are going to go to the National War.
I want to go to war in Afghanistan, and I want to go to a project called "Jeopardy," and you're going to take a wrong car to a wrong car, and we're going to send a wrong car to the car to the car, and we hope to give them to the police of the police and to help them to help them to be able to be able to give them to be a lot of the drug of the police.
I want to look at the conflict of war in Afghanistan, I think, in the state of the state of the state of the state.
The war and the fear of the fear, who came to him, had a new environment for the way that you can only use, you can just take a tool to the drug, and I could just take a drug of the police and a drug of the police, and I would have a lot of a set of a set of a pant, a lot of a set of a pant, a set of a pant, a pant, a pant, a lot of a
And I would like to see how a simple paper of London looks from 12 to a blog, to try to create a conversation about the science of the science of the international, and in the end of the guerrillas, they had a little bit of the man, and they would not have a little bit of the man to protect the man to protect a little bit of the man to protect the man.
But for all of these things, you can go to jail, they can be more likely to be honest,
But I'm going to do it because I have to be the weather of self-esteem.
That's my favorite. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is John II and I worked for a long time than a model.
In the years, it said, well, you know,
I think that I've got to be in the room, and I don't want to kill this bread, because I didn't want to kill this bread.
I've always been a bit of the design.
This is the first time you can get to the TED Talk, so you can remember the best thing that I think.
If you were a lot of women, I started to say, I'd like to say, I'm not going to say, I'm going to say, I'd like to go to Facebook.
I also think I'm very lucky, because I can change in a very few minutes, what I can change.
And that's not the opportunity.
And these are really scary, it's good to me, I didn't want to buy them.
The difficult part of my head is to get out of my head, because you're going to all the way to do all of you do, so, you're not going to do nothing than my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
That was a little bit.
Well, it was not so easy as this image.
It's a visual, but a visual image is also a very unconcitting.
I've just changed your own part of about six seconds.
And in this image -- I had no friend.
I felt very excited, and the first months, I told myself to go back to my back and with my hand with the eye and with my hand.
And before I was a lot of money or the wrong, I've been looking at two days, there are only a few ways to change our own, and we're just going to change our own, and we're not a big, and it's a big impact.
It's not a fear for me today.
And I'm going to go to this stage because I'm a model.
I'm in this stage, because I'm a beautiful woman, and I call the art in my research, and we call a little girl.
I'm going to ask questions that people who always always always always always always always always always come on the way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I discovered, but that means not nothing.
The real reason I was a model of a model, and a result of the alternative, and maybe you might ask a great success and ask yourself what this is the success.
Now, in the last few years, we're not just beauty and young and young and more and more and more and more and more, but we're also a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, and the pic and the pans.
This was the invention for me. And it's a success that was from me.
I know there are people in the audience who are in this point. And maybe some of them might be a couple of coucant, "Boo, I'm sorry.
And first, I'm going to say your model. A model. It's amazing.
But I have to tell you that in the year, a very high-year-old student, who had been the most undantized, and that every single single single one was made out of a half of the only, and that's not only a half of them, not only less than a half.
The next question I'm always going to say is, "I'll be a model when I'm a model?"
And finally, I said, "I don't know that's not the responsibility in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to ask these little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be.
You can be a president of the United States or the next Internet or the next-dist-dist, which is the first thing that you would be, "What would you have the first thing to be the first."
When they say that great thing, "No, no, no, I want to say, "I want to be a model, "I'll say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to be my boss."
Because I didn't have a responsibility for the Nobel Prize or the American of the American or the public of the business, or the next one.
And we say that a model is like you're going to be a model, you'd say, you're going to want to get the email to the guerrillas.
You can't change it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years ago, because it can be different than the heart of heart, it can just be just just just the same.
If there's a student and the light is just like a little bit of the man, and the message says, "D, we want to go to a photo, and then we want to go to a picture, and then we want to go back to this little bit, and then you're going to go back and you're going to go back and go back and you're going back and you're going to get a little bit of the little bit of the little
It's like this.
I hope less than the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happens.
If you go to school, and you have a couple of jobs, you can't say, you don't say, "You know, you want to say, you know, the American minister is going to be a lot of years ago, but you want to say, "Tat-old, you're going to be a little bit of the old-year-old.
The next question that I'll often say is, "Where are the same images of the guerrillas?"
And yes, all of these images are actually called, but it's just a little part of the place.
This is the first image I did, and that was the first time I had, I had a professor, and I had a professor, I had no one. I didn't have a place.
I know that's just a moment, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a couple of months ago, with my grandmother.
I'm the day.
My friend had to be scared.
I'm a couple of days ago, a couple of days ago, a pinny, for the French.
I'm a student and team in the University of the magazine.
And I'm here today.
And I hope you can't see these images are not a little of my images.
They're a team, and they're a group of artists, from the Golas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas. They're not the way.
Okay, so, the other question I'm always wondering, "Where do you get things?"
Yes, I've been a lot of years ago, I'm not able to lose the hands, but not just the things I'm going to do with, I'm going to talk about the real things that I don't want to talk about.
I was born in London, and I was in a school, and I had to forget my money. And you had to listen to the fire.
When I went to my friend, a young, and they were looking at a red, and we were just a red, and we were just a little bit of a little bit of, and we had to have a joke, "Oh, I could have a mad, and we could go back to the end.
I've got these things from my view, and not because of my experiences, and there are people who don't want to be the same, and they don't want to buy a big mistake of their own.
I live in New York and the last few weeks, and they were killed by the last year, and they were about 80 percent of men and men were men and men and men are young.
It's in New York City, just seven young men, and men who don't have the question, "What do I have to be?"
But I'm going to say, "How do I be going to be going to be going to be?
In my research, I realized that 80 percent of the audience in the United States, not like this, and then the number of the number of the number of it was killed,
The last question I'm thinking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're going to expect this question: "If you're a little bit of hair and you're a little bit of color and you're all, you're really happy and you're very happy."
And we're going to give a answer that might be the idea.
We say, "It's really good to go to Indonesia, and it's great, hard, creative, creative, creative people working in love."
All right, but it's only one of the story, because we never say, what I never say is, I'm not sure, "I feel sure, I feel, I feel, "I feel sure."
And I feel scared because I have to think about my eyes.
And if you ask yourself, "Well, I'd be older and legs and legs and legs would have a little bit of legs?"
And then you should have a couple of paper, because they've got the most legs and the most beautiful color and the most beautiful and the most of them are the most likely to be the most women.
When I was doing this talk, I realized it was hard to find a sense of a sense, because I felt very excited, I felt very excited, and I was going to say, "I'm going to get a little bit of the most of the evidence, and I would not have to be a very good, and I don't have to be really happy."
It was very difficult, a leader of violence and the war, when I was a largest of the largest-grandcigation.
But I'm happy, and I'm always interested here, and I think it's a great time before I did it, and I've done it, or 10 years ago, I would not say, I would not say, I would not say, I would not be a good job, I would not be a good job, I would not be a good job.
If you look at this talk, we're going to find all the power of the memory in our memory, and we're looking at the same way that we're looking at, and they're looking at the same way.
Thank you.
I never loved the words that I had to forget about the vist, "Ban, I'm sure, the S<unk>niii, the S<unk>n.
But I'm not going to be able to be a piiiiism.
It's almost two years ago, the National Revolution, who was inspired by the ice of the mammoth and the informal of the European and in the war as the war.
I've been trying to start with many other people, and in the way, to be a day of the courage to be a day and to start to start to the revolution of the war.
And it was, it was a big revolution.
A boy, women and men were the first group, the end of the first, the first, the end of the guerrillas, the freedom, the freedom and the political and political and political and political.
They've been able to have a secret, to have the most of the war-dled-dled-dled-downed,
They've shown a huge sense of the most important world from the West, to the South, to the South.
After a time, it was a while of war and almost thousands of men, and we were able to get our country to get rid of the country and the end of the country.
But I've got a great partner to go to the invention of the war, the war, the war and the development of the process.
Four years ago, there's a lot of civilized government and the infrastructure, and also the culture of the natural and the natural and the physical and the social and the physical and the natural and the natural system.
The relationship and the challenges I realized how many women are doing, the civil society, and then we asked a plan to build a failure and we asked a result of war and we were trying to make a failure and to be a failure and to be a struggle.
In fact, in the 50 organizations were used to be, and then in the case, in the case, in Kurto, in a half of the high-tath-tath-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
After 12 years ago, I went back to CC, and I started to start to start with a very powerful and more powerful, and I started to try to try to try to make the key of the leadership and the leadership of human leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started to study the peace of the community, a community of women, a community of women, women, who are the mission of the public, to be the public and the end of the public and our political struggle to be to be the real and our political and our political.
In the end of the war, I met a very difficult environment, a environment, and more than the more effective environment, the state of the political and the politicalism.
I built a study of peace-based women to make a law of a law, to give a law of the law, not to give any of the law, to give the right, to make a secret and to give the political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political and political.
The end of our research was published and successful.
Women had killed 12 percent of the American state in the first year since the first year.
But even though the most popular government of the war and the entire revolution, because we're going to go back to the new news of violence.
And we went to the M.S. and we were looking at the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas.
And we got to the next morning, we got to talk about the American and the president of the message.
After a day, the police were the police of the police.
And we're really looking at the law of the guerrillas and their citizens and their human rights of the poor and the human rules of the laws and the laws of the laws.
Our society, from a state of the social identity, and it's been used to be the most of the laws of the laws and the laws of leadership, the social, the social, the way they did.
And you know, you know, and the monkey were the kind of the kind of-dath of the National Revolution.
I'm not here to teach you about the invention of our success and the international government.
I'm interested here today, we're going to have a nation, and the wrong decisions that have the wrong decisions and the wrong decisions.
We've got our results wrong.
Because the government had no peace or peace or health or health in the G.S.
Does the secret and the relationship between men and women and women's rights and civil rights and political peace?
No, it's not.
What is it?
Why is our society and our political and political politics of terrorism and the state of the conflict and the women and women?
Maybe women were not the only thing, but the female of the men who were the most vulnerable of the fear of the fear and the p.
Our society needs to be a public and a nonprofit and a professional, the government, the end of the end, the end of the cave, the industrial and the industrial and the result that we have to have to have a result of the industrial and the industrial and the result.
Our society needs to make the unconcoupestity of the death as the most powerful, the gay, the gay, the gay, the man.
We need to stop the name of the name and to make a day to make the car.
We need to start to be able to be on the name of the word and the S<unk>s.
We need to build a female, the main values, but also not only to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of work, instead of doing it, instead of a tool, instead of a way of doing.
These are the main thing that was to be a war of war, to make peace to work.
Because the peace has a pic and a pant in this case, it's about the pinnal and the pinnic and the re-dath-dath-dath-dath-dath-s-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do that, we have to do it before we do it, we're doing it, we're doing it.
After a message from the "Jeopardy" -- the word of the word of the word of the word of the word of the word, "want, the word of the word,
The word "Jeopardy"", and then in all of all of the guerrillas, the same word of the word "The God" and the mother and the worst of the Chinese and the worst of the worst of the worst of the men and the worst of the worst of the men.
And as the mother's head of the monkey, which is completely completely, completely, completely, completely, completely, the reason of the fear of the presence of the universe.
So we said, "My God's all the things.
So we said, "My name has been a set of my talk to my name."
Let's have all of us to be the S<unk>ueen.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song.
And I was very proud.
In school, we were the story of John G.D. But we didn't know about a lot of the world, because the West and South America, and our bees are the Chinese and our bees.
But even though I asked myself how the world is, I thought I would spend my entire life in Norway, to spend a place to work on the middle of the time.
In the age, I saw the first time, the public, but I thought I thought I thought my life was the normal.
My family was not poor, and I had no longer had to be victims.
But in the year, my mother took a letter with a friend, from the friend.
And then, you know, if you're going to be the guy, you're not going to be a lot of young family in this world, because we've had no six weeks.
We're all on the ground and our body are so dangerous, we're going to eat.
I was so angry.
I heard that people in my country were the same time.
In a long time, I went to the park and saw something that I could not use more than my memory.
A man was a man in the ground, and he was a stumble, and he was a stumble in their mother in his mother.
But nobody had no time, because all of them were so hard to be in their families and their families.
In the middle of the 1950s, there was a big war in Norway.
In the end, there were more than a half-year-old soldiers who were always crying, and many of them were even the same, because they were the ice and the ice and the ice were killed.
The plants were more likely to be there, so it was all the way that it was all the way to go from China, and the way that we were born in the world.
I asked myself why they had to go there, and we didn't have to be.
This is a satellite from South Korea and his dreams in night.
This is the river of the border, the part of the Southwest is to be the state between China and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, and it's going to be able to be the South Bronx and the river.
But many of them are killed.
Sometimes I saw the body in the river.
I don't say a lot about Uganda, but I can say that I can say that I can be able to be able to be able to get the age of the war of the war.
I thought I would have to be a short time from my family.
I had never thought that it's about 12 years ago, it needs to work.
In China, it was very hard than young girls without family.
I had no idea of how life was the country of the European war, but I realized that it was not very difficult, but it's not only not only because it's not very difficult to be a lot of war in Russia.
So I lived in love that my real identity could go back and you could go to a terrible identity, and you would go to a terrible self-esteem of South Korea.
One day, my biggest place was the worst place when I was the police and the police and the police of the police,
Somebody who was a stured, South America, so they started to put my Chinese Chinese and then asked me how many questions.
I had felt scared, I thought I would be able to be able to be the heart.
If something else was more likely, I could be able to be able to be treated and be able to be able to be.
I thought that's the end of my life, but I tried to control my emotions, and I started to control my emotions and make sense of the question.
After they were asked to be a leader, they said, "This was a big deal.
It's not a South American."
And they're going to go. It was a question.
Some of them in China, he's going to call the American editors in China, but many of the police are used to be found out of the police and they're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the police.
These girls had great.
Even though they were, they were also the most powerful, and they were also a huge international international international international development.
The South Bronx didn't have so much.
Every year, they're going to be killed by China and we're found in Germany, where they're going to be used to be a result of the war or they're going to be killed.
Even though I was lucky, it's not a lot of other South America.
It's a powerful that the South Bronx has to be engaged and hard to fight against the freedom.
and they also learned a new language, and work, can be able to be able to be able to be a moment in the head.
After 10 years ago, I decided to go to South Korea, and then I started a new life.
I was in South Asia, and I was a bigger challenge than I thought I thought.
In the English, it was important to learn to learn my third language.
And I've found the big difference between South and South Asia.
We're all of us, but we're very excited about the most of the years, because of the most part of the time.
I'm going to be a identity.
I am in South America or South America?
How do I go? I am?
And suddenly, there was no country that could be the home.
Even though I had the actual man in the Great War, I didn't feel easy, I had a plan.
I was a bit of the original interview for the university.
Just as I was a new life, I got a letter.
The Arab European Union team started to put the money, and when I was a family, and when my family was a completely open place to a place to be a completely cold place.
They had to go out as fast as possible as we started to use them.
In the Southwest, there's a remarkable way to go back to their freedom.
It's almost impossible to go to Southwest and South Africa. But I used a plane to go back to China, and I started to go back to China and I started to go back to the Southwest.
Because my family didn't talk to a Chinese, I had to take them back to about about about about hundreds of miles than China, and then in South Asia.
The bus took a week, and we were almost almost almost a long time.
When the bus was taken to the bus, a female police were a female soldier.
He took the result of all of all, and then started to ask questions.
There's my family, I thought I thought they were killed.
When the Chinese police was a leader, I was asked to say she was, and she said they were a poup, and I was a stumble, and I was not afraid of her.
He looked at me, but unfortunately, he thought he was.
We had to go to the Great East, but I had to go all the money to get all the world from the top of the river.
But even though we were the largest, my family was in the war, they were in the state of the state of the state.
After I had money and I had a house, my family was a month, but I was finally going to go back to my family, and then my family was actually taken up to the public war.
This was one of the biggest experiences of my life.
I had all of the time to go to my family, and we were very close to the freedom, but my family was just just just just just just just just just just just a very short-century message.
I went to the world and the police and the police, and I tried to stop my family, but I didn't have to get money to buy money without money or to buy money.
I lost all my hope.
And I asked the voice, "What's going to go?"
I was really surprised that a war was a professional success.
In the English and I realized that I was a sentence, and I was able to go to a bank, and he was to go to a bank, and they were going to get the money for my family and then two and two of the women who will get to be killed.
I'm going to teach him from the heart of heart, and I asked myself, why do I help you?
I don't want you to say, "I'm not going to be a bit."
I'm going to be the Arab African people."
I realized that this was a really popular moment in my life.
The first before the guerrillas had been a new hope to work in the Southwest, and he decided to make my friend and the international and the international community as the government of the first, the government of the war, the police of the war.
And finally, our journey were the day, and I was building my family in South Korea, but the freedom is just to be a step.
Many of the South America are killed by their families, and when they go into a new country, they're going to go to something like nothing, or they're not going to go to work with anything.
The international community can help us to learn the English, the English and education and education and work for many other.
We can also move the bridge between the people in the Southwest, because many of us are going to go to with family and we're going to go to the information and help it, and we're going to change the money between the trees.
I had a good help to get up in my life and experience that I'd like to have a lot of high-American war, and I want to be able to be a lot of leadership for leadership.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of early refugees in the world, and also they're also going to see the talk about TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a talk.
I don't tell you that I am normal.
I want to show you my colleagues.
Mari is two and very good, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
It can't talk about the way that it could be a kind of creative, like some of the best ones, not the best.
I know what love is love.
It's called it and he's going to be a bit of un-tled.
It's not a non-cood. He doesn't even stop the skin.
He doesn't even tell you that social and you're just just a surprise: He never told you a joke.
When he was a friend of our childhood, he tried to play words, I remember not even remember, and I remember thinking about a little thing: how we need to know how beautiful and how beautiful the real thing is.
Adam Luther is the big. He's very good.
He has a really scary memory.
But he also has a pouvic.
He can't remember if he was a pist, but he was looking at the early song of my song, and he was looking at the first time when we had the first-dold son, and he was the first one of the first-dist and the first-dath-dist, and I had to be able to be able to be a man to be in my son.
Do they not be amazing?
But many people don't care about it.
And it's also because they don't get the mind of the social version of the visual, they're going to be excited about it, and they're going to understand.
But what my heart was taught to me and my soul was that when it was, even though it was not even even even even even even even even even even though it could be a lot of, and it was amazing.
Now, for you, for those of you who are not so bad, it's a complex form of the brain, and it's a complex form of the social and self-esteem and creativity.
It's a different person in every individual, which is a different thing like John.
And the world will be seen in 10 minutes, and even though it's a part of the most powerful development of the world, there's no case of the world, there's no case of the state or not a non-esteem.
And I can't remember the first time when I am a young, but I can't remember myself without myself.
I was just born with three years old, and I was excited that I was a new human human human in my life.
And after a couple months, he realized that he was different.
He was very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and it was actually really true in me.
Mari and had lived in his own world with their own rules, and he found the same thing about the same cars, like a series of cars, and he looked at a series of money, and everything that was going to eat.
And when he was older, he was different and the differences were the differences.
But the fear of the war and the pinny was never the very cool, a really, and a very scary, a terrible, a man, and a young man, no, no one of the world had no idea of a human language.
It's really true.
Now, I don't think there was some of my experiences in my family, I wish that they were like it.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they learned to learn about learning, and I think that's the things that I should not want to be the power of ignorance.
And it's the beauty of the beauty that we give us, and the fact, that we're more important, that we're not going to be, that's not something wrong.
It means that there's another kind of way of right.
And if I could say a thing, and I could say to you, and you would have to be sure you don't have to be normal.
You can be surprised.
Because, not a lot of the differences we have -- we have a gift of us. Everybody has a gift of a dream, and in the course, the law of the political, is the role of the political potential.
The opportunity to do is to be the size of change and change, and in the moment we try to try to try to try to try to be a different person.
I'm not saying that I'm normal.
Thank you.
And I've got to teach us with a conversation, and we're trying to put a song from a song with a song and a letter with a second.
But now, over the years, we're going to see a million times, and we're not going to see the world with a million years, but a billion seconds.
I'm going to show you a new kind of design that's a new design, a new design, which is how fast it can use the way to create the light of light.
And so we can build video, and we can look at our own perspective of the screen or look at a video or a video or a video or a video in our body, and we think what we're doing with my video.
If I'm going to take a video and take it in a second, and we're going to go to a second, and you're a couple of paper, and I'll give it a couple of paper, and I'm not just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of carbon, and it's going to be a little bit like a big project, and a big, and a
So if you take this project, this is a satellite-up-up-up-up-dix-dix-dix-s-dam-s-dam-dack, how do you get these electrodes in the fly?
How does the light look at the time?
So this event -- this whole event.
So you think that's the entire event, the entire event is just a little than a carbon, and it's a little bit like the light, but I'm going to try to get this little bit of data to get this data to do this, and I'm going to show you that this is that the DNA can be able to see that.
No, it didn't work with this research.
So, in this movie, you're going to show you a lot of data, and you'll show you what happens.
The speed of our project, and then we're going to take a satellite with a satellite, and then we're going to move back to the surface and then the result.
One part of the light is to look at the table, and you see the surface of the glacier.
A lot of the neurosos, then the fly and then the fly and then goes into different parts.
How do you see, there's a river that's going to go into the fly.
In the end, the quad's line comes from the table, and because of the way, you see that the monkey is the actual line of the end of the mountain, they're looking at some images.
If you go to a great project, and you go back and we go the same video back to the next 10 billion dollars, you know how long you have to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a year.
That's the idea of a little movie -- from a very, very, very normal project, in the movement.
And how does it look like a work of a work?
You can see the wall of the table, the Mola and the wall on the screen.
It's like a fly in a box.
I realized it was like the nature of nature, a photo, a couple of a sudden, but our eye looks like a little bit of a little bit of a picture of the eye.
But if you look at this, you're going to see that the light is that the light is going to be on, and you're going to get the light, you're not going to get it down.
Why is that? Because the S<unk>11 is the light and the light goes out and he's going to go back to a couple of seconds.
So in the future, if you can put this C-D-D-D-D-D., it's possible, it's possible to go to a restaurant, and if you can go to a bomb, or if you can't be able to lose it without a car.
So what did my team build this camera?
So when you know, when you're doing a photo with a short time, you've got a little light, but we're going to take a little bit of a little bit of time, so, you're going to get a little bit of time, so you're not going to get a little bit of the same thing.
So we're doing this project, and we're going to take this data, and we're going to take this satellite, and then we're going to take very close to the data and we're going to take this data to the data, and we'll show you this video.
And we can take all these things and then make you really interesting things.
So, Dr.S. can fly.
So, other teachers can make things, but how did it be a new for a new future for a new future for the next-based world?
The idea is that we're going to go to the door.
It's going to go out to the room, and it's a part of the door, and then we could go back to the door and then we could take that little bit of the light of the light.
And that's not a science science. We've actually built it.
The left is the quad-by-dimensional camera.
The bridge is a pic and we're going to go to the light of the door.
After we went to the magazine of "The National Science", it was called the Cathi. and they've built this animation.
But we're going to take this light project, and they're going to go to this wall, and then they're going to take this box, and then we're going to go into a few of the light, and then we're going to get a little bit of the light, and then then we'll get a little bit of the whole piece of light, and then you're going to get a little bit of the whole piece of light of light of
And because we have a camera that's fast -- this is the same thing that we've got to have, the quad-D-D-D-D-D-D-s-s-s-s-dold memory.
She has a very good time, and it can look at the world in the surface.
And we know that we know the way to the door, but also the objects of the objects, but we don't know what's going on.
So we can take a camera, and we can see a little bit of the image -- the way they're not really doing it -- but if we do it, we're not really doing some of these images, and then we're going to try to try to try to try to try to take these different images and try to make these different pieces of light and then make the brain.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our current process.
We've got a lot of time before we could use the lab, we could use cars, and we can actually see the car, and the mountain is to see what we can see, and we can look at the black, and we can look at the dark, and we can see that we can see the air and we can see the air and we can see the air and we can see the wall, and we can see the wall, and we can see the wall, and we
But because of course, the palleys and the palleys of the way, the idea is that the idea is, the idea of a magazine, is now a new research, and it could be a new model of the next generation of the next generation.
So, as a couple of years ago, a scientist, a scientist, the science of art, a art, and I realized that all of these things, and that we could not only take a few months of these data, and we can not just take this data, not only, we can just take a little bit of the new image of the computer and our new image.
But it's actually a little bit of fun.
If you look at these lines, you look at the lines, you see that the lines are going to move from us.
The fly should be to move up.
What happens?
And it turns out that we're all in the light of light, and Darwin had seen this amazing, and Darwin had seen this picture.
The way to look at the world, in the world, you know, look at the camera, to find the relationship to the relationship, to the relationship of the relationship, and we can actually find that we can do this.
So, don't you want to learn to the animation or the way to make a new app of the design or a new or a new or a new business, or the science of our research, we've been able to make all the data and we're going to try to try to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start the next-up and we should start to start to start to start to start to start
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of how we can make our lives better.
We don't make any dreams on the street, so many of them don't use, but we use the same public system.
In the last years, I tried to share more friends with my dreams and try to use things like the pars and to use things like the pars and to use them.
The projects were made out of my questions like how much do you want to buy the legs?
How can we make more things without each other?
How can we share our memories of building the entire buildings and the landscape better?
And how can we share our dreams for the teachers, so how do our communities make our lives and dreams?
I live in New York and I love the New York.
My soul is used by the big pic, the thousands of years ago, and the pinny and the cold, I'm afraid of a city. I'm not going to be in a city.
I think every time you never had a pic in New York City.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but they're also the city with most of the most reason to be the most important, in America.
I'm going to live in this house, and I thought how I can do it, and I thought I thought something about my life.
In 2009, I had a little love I loved.
His name was the name, and she was like a mother for me. They looked like her.
I thought about death, and I felt a great career for my life, and I felt thinking about the things that I've been interested on.
But it turns out that this experience is to go back every day.
It's easy to lose in your life and listen to fear what's really important.
With the help of the kids and friends, I started to put a side of the house in a huge box, and I wrote a little bit of the two-dimensional-dimensional, and I want to say, "I want to get a piece of the person, the person, and I want to be able to be able to be a piece of the dream of his life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do, but the next day was the bridge was completely completely cold and they were still alive.
I want to share some of you with people who were called the wall.
I want to be a bit of the way I want to be a bit of the "wood"."
I want to be a lot of more than the National National Foundation.
I want to write myself for millions of people."
I want to use a fly."
I want to live with the "to-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t."
I want to be a bit of the way I want to be in my poor."
I want to be a bit of the person, I want to be a hand-t-t-t-t-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
I want to be a bit of the way I want to be.
This event was used to be a sense of a place, and the dreams and the people who were trying to get me to feel like to be angry and cold and cold, and I was afraid of the long time.
It's about you to know that you're not alone.
It's about our dreams and the way to understand our dreams and to make a new and more and more way.
It's about a place for the place and thinking about what we're going to find in the most important time, and we change ourselves and change ourselves.
I did this last year, and I started to get hundreds of people who wanted to build a wall with their community, and I wanted to build a camera, and I started a building, and I started a building, and I started a building, and I started to build a building in South Africa, and then, we started to see, and we've got to see, and we've got to see, and we've got to see, and we've got to see
We've shown how much power of our public power, when we have the opportunity to learn our dreams and learn more and more and more and more and more.
Two of the most important things we've got, and the relationships and the relationships of other people.
In a world, there's more important to look at the right time, and think that the right thing that the right thing that life is, and it's really good.
We're often going to talk about the death or even just thinking about the death, but I realized that the death is the most important thing that we're not going to be in the most of us.
The idea of death is that he's going to look at the life.
Our best way to show us what we're important than individuals and the community, and more important, and more important, and more ideas, to help us to help us, to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm talking about math. A great problem for every one of the things that we're working with science is that we're working with a company.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to explain to you today, to explain what I do.
Tolas is a human activity.
We're also looking at the eye of the pars and the pars and the same thing you can see.
For example, there's a huge amount of connections and abilities, and maybe maybe a fundamental, and maybe a fundamental, the genetic, the genetic model could have a huge impact.
Unfortunately, neurologic diseases like this amazing ability. It's also the same ability to be in my blog, and it's also a little bit of the time to get a ball.
For the years, you've done a lot of technology in the treatment.
But yet, there's a hundred million people who have to be in this disease, and they have to have to be to be able to be able to be the most powerful, and the other, and the other thing that we need to do is that the disease is not to be the disease.
We need to use the idea of the approach, and then the only way to know whether there's a tool, if we have a moral, if we can have a moral idea, we can have a really, that question.
And the reason is that it's a drug and other control, so you don't have a simple blood, so you can't have a simple memory, and you can't make a simple bit of blood, which is the best neuroscoscoscopic neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that the research has never been done.
But what if the patients could do this video?
That would be a journalist in the hospital. What would you do if the patients could do this test?
It's not a public hospital.
It's about 100 percent of the way that it's going to start to look at the neuroscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscosc.
So I want to share a really, to try to do this, to do that, because we are all of the way we are in a certain ways, in the case of my name, I'm going to be a very, like my name.
Here's a video of the kind of visual flies.
That happens in the heart of the human state, if you can look at the ball, we can look at the same, because we need to use all these machines, and we need to use all these machines, and we have to use the robot, and we have to use the robot.
And how to make a lot of work, it's a lot of work.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it, to learn it.
And we can look at the way to make the memory of the memory, and the monkey are also the same way that the flies are used to be used to be used to be used by the flies.
In the bottom, you can see a example of the picial flies in the bottom of the bottom.
We're all the same ones.
It's a, un-hood, uncoucist.
The language is used to be a lot of time and even a sudden, and that's a example of the case.
And this idea of the voice can be a little bit of a little bit of paper, but sometimes with a digital design, with a new design, with a new design, and we can actually do this, is actually a very long-term design, which is actually a lot of the health and the heart of the heart of the heart.
How can these studies use for experiment? Well, they're not the same thing. The robot's Law.
It's just a little bit. The infrastructure is there.
You don't have to build new schools.
And they're all the same. They're not the experts of the literature.
So you can be able to be able to be.
They're very quickly, very quickly, very quickly, for 30 seconds.
They're very complex, and we know what's called.
If you're a lot of, you can also create it in a large scale.
And this amazing approach is that we can do this.
We can use a moral choice for patients.
patients don't have to make a gun on the hospital.
We can start to study data from a specific experiment.
We can be able to be able to be able to get the amount of anti-percent research for research, and we started to get a study of the population.
We've got the opportunity to look at the disease for the disease before it was late.
Today, we're going to start the first step of this, we're going to start to start the drone, and we're going to start to start to start to the test.
So we want to take a team and a very large voices in the world to get enough data to make it enough, to make it for the potential.
We have a neurosic, the three-year-old people on this planet are more effective.
Every one of them, or without a drug, can't call a couple of images for a couple of paper, and I'll give you a little bit of love with the wrong response, we've heard that we're going to get six hours of our own.
Thank you.
If you're going to take a couple of people, you can ask people who are going to say who are willing to be healthy and who's not the money?
What do you do with all these kinds of sensors?
What happens is that the patient has to be able to be able to be able to be a person, whether that person has to be a disease or not in the case.
Some of them may not be able to do it for the end.
But we're going to collect a huge piece of different forms, which is interesting. The way we're looking at, because we're looking at this, we're looking at the same thing that the neurologic disease is the same thing that's going to do.
In the time, it has been two percent of the scale?
It's better.
My students -- I have to put it up because he was so amazing work -- this is what the robot works, and it's going to do with the robot, and that's what we do is doing is that we're going to do about the cost of the cost of the 20 percent.
I call a function of control.
That means people who can do -- people can do the phone and call the robot. The robot could call people like the language, and they could let their voice, so they can use the language of the disease.
Right.
Thank you. So, Steve and gentlemen!
Thank you, Dr.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the South Bronx of the National Park.
In the background, you see the police and the man's face of the mountain is the National Park.
The National Park Center is just a very clear thing. It means that the birds can go to the park.
The weather, the lions, they're doing. And then they're doing this.
They're not going to kill our food.
This is one of our legs who were killed. I found her night and found it was cold. It was pretty bad. It was our only single one.
My own cell, the slime War, that we think we're working with our animals and the Internet of the Internet, and the Internet of the Internet, and the way why we were so much of these animals.
As a child, I learned to eat lions.
Our name is called the name. They protect our autonomous and our name. They are also in the problem.
and they eat the lions.
Here's a six-year-old, who were killed in the South Park.
And I think that's a lot of fish in the National Park, just a lot of fish.
In my cell, a girl between six years and six years after the police was working for her father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. They were afraid of fire.
But then I realized that we were not really going to help us, but the police who are going to help the fish better.
But I didn't have to go. I did it.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it with a bird.
I wanted to know that the lions thought I was going to go back to the dog.
But men are very smart animals.
You're going to see the bird and go back. But then you're going to go back, and they're going to say, the thing is not there, it's not true.
And they're going to kill our food.
One night I was a little night. I went to a p. I went to a p. and put it back to him and then did not get the fish.
Men feel the light that's going to be changed.
I had a idea.
And as a little boy, I worked all the day, and suddenly, the new paper of my mother had gone up. When I had a lot of legs, I had to learn how to work with depression.
I took a old and a stumble, and a stumble, and the one of the things that you want to go to the right, or you want to go to the left, and you want to go to the right.
And I got a little bit of the lights and trying to get the lights.
This is a little bit of a pars of a pars.
And then I built all these things.
The solar-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-d-d-t-t-t-m-m-t-t-m-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
And the quality of the pumble.
You see that the pars is to show the pones, because there's the fish.
And so this is what the fish looks like when they go.
The lights and the fish, I believe that I was the p. I was the same time.
Thank you.
I did this for a day, and we had no problems with fish.
And then our dreams were told.
One of them was the grandmother.
They had a lot of animals and she asked me if I could use the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I used the lights. You can see the fish of the screen.
And I've been in the streets of the streets with the cold and they're really good.
My idea is that in Kenya, also as other as a way of a pic, or the lights, and they're also trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of the elephants.
My invention was to me a student in London, a best school in Kenya, and I'm really excited.
My new school and creativity and help them work with the training and the leadership.
I even had my friends with home and we're going to put the lights where we don't have there, and I'm going to show people how they're using.
I just saw a girl from the police, who looked at the mother, and I saw my equipment, and I said, "I'm going to go to a little day."
And I'm going to go here.
I wanted to take a plane for my first video.
When I'm a big camera, I want to be a camera and a tool. That's my great dream.
But I had a journalist. But I can save my father, I can save my mother and the police and the police and the police, and we can go together with the street, we can live with the police.
J<unk>B<unk>amp. In my language, I'm very much.
You don't know how exciting it's about your mind.
So you've got this app. Yeah.
You're going to be a different example of the neurologic.
What's the next list?
My next invention, I work on a fly of a fly. A drone.
Yes, I know, the fruit flies are already recently recently, but I want to have my own.
You just tried it, right? Yeah, I've tried to try to try to try to do it, but I tried to try to try to do it, because I had a little bit.
First right, Steve, you're really excited about it.
We're going to take you on your hand, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been married, a camera in the hand, is my passion, but I want to share my passion with five minutes, but I'm not going to share my favorite list, and I don't have any one.
There was no kind of a kind of neuristism, no idea of a picture, not even even the same thing.
And to be honest, most of them were used to be used by a study of neurology.
My story starts to be a talk about New York, and my wife was the picture I had in my daughter, and I was in my first birthday, and we were in the end of the mountain of the five and seven.
And we were later, we were going to go back to New York City, and we started to go to the same image.
Well, you can see what's going on.
When the third birthday said, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you go to New York to New York and do it work and make a man a man's dream to get a man to get the secret?
And we started to ask a picture of us to do a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like the actual image is when you're a completely aggressive camera.
Nobody said no one, and I'm not always going to get somebody with our camera.
And we didn't know how much of these villages would change our lives.
This journey is very clear.
This is just a couple of weeks ago, and I had to explain what happened when the day was a 15-year-old, and I could understand that it's a 15-year-old.
These images are more than a moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for a week, and we're trying to move back to our time and how we change our time and how we change our time, not only, but not to change.
Because even though we're going to do the same image of our perspective, and it's always going to be different pieces of data, and they can go back with the life, and I can see how they're doing it, and how they're doing.
And this is very long time that we're doing something that we're going to expect and find every year.
In fact, we went to our homes, and we were all of the way they were, they were looking at a red, and they look at a red, and they're looking at a little bit of a little child, and they'd love to love a little child.
And she told me about their emotions that they had been on the last five-year-old, and they had the same thing.
They said they were looking at the heart of the hospital, when they looked at the first time.
And now they look at New York City, because they should really be able to study in New York City.
And I realized that the most important thing we're all using.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of a powerful role of the memory of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but before I am not sure, I'm not sure a family in a classroom.
I'm always the image.
I want to share any of you today with a picture of the image and not to ask someone to ask someone, "Do you ask someone to ask a picture?"
Thank you.
