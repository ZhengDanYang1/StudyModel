When I was 11 years old, I was shocked by the sounds of the sounds of the window.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show of the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at the time, because the news is often depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
This morning, I will never forget.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
So I was preparing five years to do this for a boy and I was commelled my older sister who didn't have to take care of a secret school.
And so we could both go to school.
Every day, we took another way to make no one possible guess where we went.
We're going to have our books in shopping bags so it looked like we'd just go shopping.
We're going to be in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was kind of nasty, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then, after a week, the class had to come out, because the Taliban had been attacked.
We never really were sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to fight us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a lot of happiness in a family where education was important and valued and valued daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign man from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was forced to get out of his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retirement, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- the first thing in his family who ever received a school education.
And it was always clear that his kids would get education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much greater risk to send his kids to school.
I know that in the years, I was frustrated with the Taliban, sometimes, by the time, by our life, by the constant fear and the interruption of the interruption.
I had good pleasure to give up, but my father said, "Taughter, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced from your house in war.
But one thing will remain you: what's in there. And even if we need to pay our blood for your school, we will do that.
So -- do you want to give back to me?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed over decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, I have a higher degree in high school than the junior degree, and if my family didn't have been so much of my education for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proud unconventional of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was harassed by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who shared me.
He's not just talking to my college degree, but also the first woman I was, and he's the car running through Kabul.
My family believes to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more and more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped to build SOLA, the first and maybe only public service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school training is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school are with great ambition to consider all of them.
And to see how their parents and fathers are facing for them, including my parents, despite all, and against all the damage of the conflict.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they're death through a bomb on the street just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rings, and he swallowed his voice, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
He said, "Well, now, when you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's future on the game because of your old and over-lived ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often prased in the West: the majority of us who succeed, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is true that their success is also its success.
That's not what our mothers are not supposed to be important in our success.
They're often the ones that are highly committed to the most compelling future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today in Afghanistan, over three million girls are beating the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to look at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term and changed with the Department of the U.S. troops.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see the students in my school, and their parents who are willing to use them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me, and the hope and the unmanned possibilities, and remember every day, the girl who visit the SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even a living -- my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- I have -- I have Kenya, Kenya, I've been working in the Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to work on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, thought that we are good people and we were very good at work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we did.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of the Sambia how to grow food.
We came to Italian seed in South Korea, in this crazy valley, which leads to Sambesi Flakes, and we trained the local population to grow the Russian tomato and zchini and ...
Of course, the local had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they also came up.
We were amazed that there was no such waste of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God for God that we're here!"
"Fon time in time to save people from the oambia in front of the slime."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-maratic tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the rabamb, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato and red were red, about 200 nousers came out of the river and they all cut out.
We said to the Sambors, "Oh God, the pierper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great at Italy in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the pierper.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we didn't have the intermedcted African people.
They should read the book "Dead Aid" from Dambisa Moyo, she's a cross-terrorist economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money did.
Just read her book.
You know, reading about a African woman, what we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, colonialists, mission zones, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We paralize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are made by the Latin root, which means "Vather."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture, like they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I treat every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bida," boss.
I was laughed at the book when I read "Small's "Sautally" of Schider. He said, especially in the economic development of the business, if people don't want help, they will let them calm.
That should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Now, tomorrow, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolic?
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to people and I created a system called Business Service, where never gets started, anyone will never be motivated, but you will be able to be the service of the local passion, the gay man, the dream of being a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you put them together with the locals.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing to humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why, instead of going to a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have been part of it, and they will never be able to say public, what they want to do with their money, what opportunity they see.
Design has this blind spot.
The smartest people of the community don't know because they never seem to be public meetings.
We're working one to do that, and we've got to be able to make a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job of working.
This is the hospital of the company, the hospital of the operating system that you're sitting in your house with your kitchen and in the cafe, helps you to find the tools to transform your passion in a way that life lives.
I tried this in vitum, West missions.
I graduated to the time, and I tried to get out of the abrupt flaws, where we say to others what they should do to escape.
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and in the first three days, I had my first client, and I helped him, and he was a fish in a garage, and he was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then they came to the fishermen, and they said, "You could help the Mai.
I helped these five fish farmers work together and they didn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany to 60 cents a car, but to Japan for the sushi store for 15 dollars. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
In a year, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- so the government says, "Let's try again."
We did it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've helped 50,000 companies in the platform.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be able to get on loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter Cochrane was a philosophy professor before he was involved in business. Peter Cochrane said: Design is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneur spirit.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest human being is about to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that into one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they will get distracted.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who are passionate about intelligence and passion?
For those of you who are most comfortable this morning?
<unk>"Vom, passionate people. You've got this.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution -- denial-efficient fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freonian form of self-interest is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to build, transport, and to engage with them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a great story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1860 in the year.
In 180, they came together and they were using what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was an absolute thing: the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get the fish, and it would be impossible to get the dung of six million horses.
Because they went in the dung.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that makes life disappear from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be offered to discourse.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate services.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, all of which you have to do is to get the product that needs to be super-powered, the financial system needs to be great and it has to be massive.
You know what?
We've never met a single person who's going to make something happen at the same time, sell it and can take care of the money.
That's not what it is.
This person was never born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100th-century companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wivhouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been so common, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in Northtonland entrepreneurship, and we're starting to teach the lessons to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the task of the 16 year-old woman is to support in the first two sides of Richard Bransonsological geography, how often he uses the word "t" and how much of the word "wewe" is.
Never even "ich" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the people who have a small entrepreneur's background, sit in cafas and Bars. They're going to do what someone in this gentleman did for this gentleman who speaks about this subject. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't." "Do you feel someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping the entrepreneurship of organizations to help them find the means that we found that the wonders of the intelligence of the local population can make the culture of this community change, and the economy of this community, just by the ability to identify the passion, energy and the imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be, that Alice has to be in the miracle country.
So the Penn State University asked me -- a business leader for communication -- to split engineers in communication.
I was scared.
Real fear. Fear for those students with their great brains and their great books and their great books, and their great words, I don't know.
But when the conversation evolved, he took me like Alice when she was walking down to the organ of the pig and saw a door in a completely new world.
I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the thought they had, and I wanted to find that other miracles in the country.
I think to open up these door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the greatest problems that we're doing, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, then it's not going to be progress. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-humanististist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come out if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit down.
I want to show you some ways of doing it, how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy doing with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to us is, well?
Saying to us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only tells us that their picids are looking at us, but also tells us that their picids, the plastic structure in our bones, are studying it, because it's important to understand osteoposis and treat.
And if you describe what you do, then you're going to have preventable language.
Now, in terms of the translation, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
I think you could use "tid" and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you don't just tell you -- space and time, what is much more comfortable for us?
We're trying to make sense of understanding, not the same way to stick down the same level.
As Einstein said, "Take things are as easy as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific field without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Some things are in taking care of this: examples, examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can pull us into your mind.
And if you're in your work, you're going to get rid of the data.
Have you ever wondered why it's called "reacting"?
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is going to be weeks, and with those dots, your first audience will be your audience.
It's not just boring, it's too boring, but it's too much about the conversation about our brain, and it's very quickly challenged.
This is an example of Genevieve Brown, which is much more powerful. It shows that the particular structure of the prosthetic limb is so stable that even the inspiration of the unique design of the Eiffel worm.
The trick here is to use a single, easy term, where the audience is going to lose the thread, and then it can adjust images and graphics that also express our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways of helping us to open up these towers and see the wonders that science and technology is being brought into.
because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to make the "Nerdin in me" tightly tightly, I want to sum up all of this equation.
Now, looking at your science and your thinking spots and your thinking, they're sharing these things through the popular, so the audience is important, and they're multiplying the passion that you've done for your incredible work: and then they're making incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, it's really what I'm really interested in.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the public of humanity.
You can make a message with a cell phone, and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on soundCloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1996, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city at the time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we're imagining that all these people who have been coming and asked changes had a cell phone in the bag.
Who's got a phone phone in the room?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, hold it up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost everyone has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about myself and my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Fust data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.R. set up a policy.
This is a legal rule of law enforcement.
This is a rule that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service in the entire country, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored in the same information for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to have this protection system.
We want self-driving in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and the Internet service to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were being dedled on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Funness rather than fear."
And some people even said this could be on Stasi 2.0.
Stye was the headache orchardi in East Germany.
And I also wonder if that really works.
Can you really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the billage company, which was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please send all of the information you've stored on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I couldn't get the right answer. Just even blue blue.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that you're doing on it.
So I decided to put a court trial on them because I wanted to get that information.
But the post-up dictionary said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
And then it came to an comparison to them.
I'll go back to the front of what they all got to do.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. line was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown impact with a CD.
And on the CD, that's what it was.
35.830 lines of information.
First, I saw it, and I said to me, well, it's a huge file. My move.
But then I realized, after a while, that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical about what should I do with it?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what's called the defenseship.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is an visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and back.
You can take every step I do, you can track.
And you can even see how I'm driving from Frankfurt to the train to K<unk>n, and how many calls I'm going to do.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit scared.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk to each other.
And then we'll put some friends in and call them each other.
And then after a while, you're calling up, and we're going to call you, and we've got this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see it all.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's sending an email, all of this is possible if you're going to have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said to the beginning, we imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins had had in their bag in 1989,
And Stasi had known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi had known who had been the leaders, then maybe that would never happen.
The case of the Berlin wall might have not been taken out.
And then, not the case of the iron curtain.
Because today's national agency and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and corrective.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all the time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They need to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you say, just because companies and government places have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to the information that they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your phone, remember that you need to fight the self-replication of the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Spring shops, open restaurants, refrigeration spaces.
So the city map is taking place and they thought about changing the name of South Central Central so that he's standing for something else, she changed it in South Los Angeles, and as if that's going to change what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Physical stores, rapid-time restaurants, refrigeration spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Ahrade and the Drivebys.
The comor is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles to unconditionable diseases.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than about Beverly Hills, which is about 12 kilometers away.
I couldn't even get to the first.
And I wondered how you would feel like if you had no access to healthy food, if you go out of the house every time you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I'm going to make toast and sell like the railroad.
I see comedy centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no more fun of 45 minutes of commissions to get an apple that's not under pesticide.
So I planted a food bar in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to be able to engage.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the middle.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grums, together, and we started planting my food bar, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a sports group, together from gardening from all the social layers and from the entire city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically raised me a ticket, and he said that I had to remove my garden, the perimeter was a riotary.
And I thought, "Well, come here, right?
A riotic of food consumption for food consumption on a piece of land that you're completely concerned about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Hermit."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
L.A. Times received wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and talked to the city department, and a member of Green Ground Station. They signed up a petition on Change.org and with 900 regulations we were successful.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even set up and said they support it and love what we do.
So, what should they do?
L.A. has the most lezrooms in the city.
They have 67 miles of space in Brk.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why should they not find it okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my "Lierbot," I'm saying people should grow their own food.
To expand his own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm going to be part of this pre-viewing reality that's made by other people, and I'm going to make my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Communication is my graffiti. I'm going to plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, and the walls are interrupted, I'm going to get lawn and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my impact for this stuff.
You'd be surprised by what the ground is, if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
They would wonder how kids are affected.
Now, gardening is the most athletic and the most bold act you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get strawberry straw.
I remember that time, when these mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked at them.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not a reason for the street."
I was struck when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only has me empowered to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you don't fear that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Euc<unk><unk><unk><unk><unk> No, no, I don't fear they're going to make it sound.
It's on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take their health back."
In the other days, I put a garden in this homeless house in the inner city of L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to cash the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it had been affected, and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it only for a moment.
Green Grances have already planted about 20 gardens.
And so we went to our lab and we had 50 people and we did all of these volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomato.
But if they don't get anything from it, if they didn't show how to affect the minds and the body, they eat blind, whatever you're listening to them.
I see young people who want to work, but they fit in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and they don't get anywhere else.
I think of the gardeners as a chance of training these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do it.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole apartment in gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free check, because free is not sustainable.
The comet of sustainability is you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about getting people work and getting kids from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy of being pride and honorful when you build their own food, and when you open the farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want to be the rest of the ecological rebels, the gang, the gang gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the window.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to get a shower, you know?
And let the weapon be your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me, if you want to sit in a game and want to make a meeting where you talk about it, and you want to make some pots.
If you want to meet me, you come with your knees, in my backyard, so we can plant some pistle.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollyihoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nollygoster" means "free politicians."
Even though a newspaper officer in the 19th century, a better definition of a sentence: "A Snollygoy is someone who is in a criminal basis, independent of party, or program, or performance, and his success by the pure force of the monomatic acoustic sensibility."
I have no idea what the memory is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So 1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers couldn't get the exact same word of debut.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brassby Crosby that had been set up with Parliament.
They threw him in the Tower of London, and they would give him a bet, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to fight, and eventually he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so as strong as Brass." Many believe.
Brass is a little bit of the word for the White Pass.
But that's not true. It's a government of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are interacted, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it's just reached independence.
You could see the question of how to call George Washington, the head of the state.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a utopian nation?
and that's been debated for a long time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of recommendations.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his Congissality, George Washington, and again, the police of the people of the United States of America's Washington Washington Washington.
Not such a thing.
Some people just wanted to call him King.
They thought that was a viable one.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored with this argument three weeks.
I read the course of a meeting book that always writes, "I've been able to get the same issue."
The reason for the delay, and the boredness was that the representative house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be good. They didn't want to get him.
King call it, and maybe even gives it to ideas to their own.
They wanted to give him the most humility, the most vulnerable, the most sinest title that they could find.
This title was "Pory."
President. They didn't invent the title. He happened before. But he just meant that someone was setting up a gathering.
It's kind of like a pre-driving officer.
He had no longer the size of the book "tid" or "tast water."
Sometimes there were little protests of civilized and government groups, but it was really a mismanned title.
So the Senate refused to get it.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign carriers.
Who gets serious to him if he has a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't come.
Instead, you want to be a word of the law, not to be able to be able to be aware of the law of the law, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they didn't agree because of their honest respect to the opinions and the potential of civic nations, whether it's in the Republic of the police of the state, whether it's the state of the state, not respected, or the preservation of the people who are not the people who are in the
You can learn three interesting things about it.
First, and I think that's best -- well, I couldn't figure out if the Senate ever suggested the name of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he was just listening to the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary -- -- you wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America today is, isn't it so humorous, right?
And this has to do with a little more than 5,000 nucleoids of dangers that he has, and the largest economy in the world and a flan of drone drone and all this stuff.
The reality and history have given the size.
And so the Senate ended up going.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the noise of self-destruction -- well, it was like this.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with the 5,000 nuclear fireheads and so forth.
So at the end of the country, the Senate and the representative house lost, because nobody feels humbly, if you're told that you're the president of the United States now.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and to control reality, but actually the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rugs in the fight to Stugalabad, a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to put my black life bag on a pair of brown leatherers and rodled a rocket in the direction of the government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been up with war for a long time, but after the War, with Pyjama party and football and fighting with racist-downers and alliances and racial demonstrations that never had to live with communism and Afghanistan and Afghanistan, and re-discovered, before I knew what that meant.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I think, a life-Afghane, South nations, South-counting of God's Germades, and a moralist, and a radical political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the past nine years, created and created.
So, in Afghanistan, there are lots of great things about art you could do, but I personally don't like to paint a rain shutter. I want to make art that makes the personality confused and composing authority and re-explroducted reality and even using a kind of imaginary citizen imagination to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of jihad -- the guy who is using his jihad against communists like "Pop Starfling" and used criminal harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihad lawyer, as the parliament, to prepare and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Please choose! I make jihad and I am rich."
And trying to use this campaign to let this Mafiosi to take care of the race as an Asian race.
I want to go to corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rearst," where you're going to be a policeman, a false control position on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money from them, and giving them money to the police department in Kabul, and they hope that they hope that they would take us 100 of them.
I want to look at how conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, the process of conflict.
The war and the alien views that came with him created a new environment for St. and fashion that you can only capture, by creating a fashion of intervention for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine the pist of local Afghan forces with a protective or multiple compostable in a neetricial.
And I'd like to see how a simple twist from Kabul looks between Kiplive Appellell, to create a dialogue about this, that today's development development development development of its origins in the past-downed rhetoric of the White House, to have a brown man to even protect him and even a little bit of a civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misleading.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, right?
I felt that now, in the room, there's a kind of awkward tension, because I wouldn't have been wearing this dress.
Fortunately, I have something else to change.
This is the first time someone is going to join the TED stage, so you can appreciate that.
If some women were really upset when I came out, you don't need to say this now, I read it on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think about me.
And it's not the opportunity to do that.
These incidents are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me up, so you're not doing anything until it's over my head.
Okay.
Why did I do that now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, I hope it was not as embarrassing as this picture.
A visual image is powerful, but it's also a piece of roughness.
I've changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never had a friend, actually.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back, and I would put my hand in my hair.
And besides surgeries or false leystune, I've been trying to make a lot of days ago, there are very few ways to change our expressions, and our expressions have been -- even though it's super-exportible and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable to me is to be honest today.
And I stand on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
Now, I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but to the honest way.
The first question is, "How will you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I'm discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became an model is a winning in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the past few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, in terms of what we're mechanized, but also as big, humor, feminine and bright leaders.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashioners like this, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smake. Liu."
And first, I'm commenting your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all of the modules that have been counted on the course of the walk, each one that was being dred, and that there were only 677 modules or less than four percent of them.
The next question that I'm always asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown up?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President's President or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninja heart surgeon who would be completely wrong, because you would be the first."
When they're still saying, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become an model," then I say, "Am my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head minister of the American bird, or the business agent of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that later, you want to become an model, like, you'd say that you'd want to win the Jacker in the serto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of model model, because otherwise, as a heart surgeon, it can be just expanding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam of radiation, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo," now the leg goes well, beautiful, and long, so long, that arm goes back to the back, is on the head of three-quarters, and you just move back, and you see, you see, you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you've done a lot of work, and you can't say much more, and if you want to be President of the United States, but you're going to be like, "10 years of interdiction, you'll be kind of weird.
The next question that I've been asked to me is, "Who is going to kill all the photos?"
And yes, so all of these photos are going to be cut, but that's just a little bit of what happened.
This is the very first photo I did, and that was the very first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me on the day of this shuttle.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days ago, a Shakeing for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the D magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and make-upists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and their assistants and their legislators. They're building.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Do you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot gloves of shoes that I can never wear, except anything, but the things I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and I gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend, a horrible driver, and they were going to a red light switch, and of course we were stopped. It took a "Excuse me, Mr. Mr. Peble, and we could go on.
I've got these useless things because of my appearance, and I don't have people who pay attention to their appearance and they're not paying a high price of their personality.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and shot in the last year, were 85 percent black and Latino and mostly young men.
It's only 177,000 young men and Latino children who don't ask the question, "Who am I listening to?"
But, how many times am I going to wake up? When am I going to wake up?"
And in my research on this talk, I found out that 53 percent of all the 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent if they got 17 percent.
The last question about me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they expect that answer, "If you're a little bit thin and you're a glowing hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And we're going to give a answer that might be the impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's only one half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, what I never said before, is, "I feel safe."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Do I feel happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some models, because they have the thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the most cool flipples and they are the ones that look at their appearance of their mind are probably unsafe women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very hard to me to get a more honest balance, because one thing I felt very uncomfortable was to get me here and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile that was put into my throat." And it feels very good, and it doesn't feel like, "And I don't always feel happy."
It was very difficult to open up a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the greatest user drivers of it.
But I'm also happy and I feel honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done here before 10 or 20 years before I've been rejected and my career, because I probably wouldn't tell how to my first job, or maybe I wouldn't be paid as college, which is so critical.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misbehakening failures and failures.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, sorry, Gaddafi resistance.
But never will be something like a Gaddi revolution."
It's been nearly two years since the Dutch revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass destruction and in the natural world as well as the Egyptian revolution.
I connected to many other leyans, in and outside of the world, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyranny regime of Gadadrosis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, boy, gay women and men stood in the first row, the end of the regime, held the free, dignity and social justice in the air.
They've been demonstrated by this kind of precursor to the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far east to the south.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to break the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a great home, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation of action.
Over four decades, Gaddafis tyrannis has destroyed both the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the pink-dic society.
The devastation and the challenges, I realized, as many other women, that civil society, helped rebuild, and we challenged a set of unoriented and unchanging transition to democracy and national failure.
Nearly 200 organizations have been created, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of arrival, I came back to Lybia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started working on the issues of the capacity of creating human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peace platform of Leyier women, a movement of women, leaders of various lives, whose goal is to live in public for the sociic empowerment of women, and to be able to consider our right to the right to vote in the political and peace creation.
In the elections, I met a very hard environment, a environment that was more powerful and more polarized. A environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and reconfigure.
I was running a campaign to the peace platform of leadership, to get women to get an under-profit vote, a law that would give everyone to the background, whether it's the right to vote and to decide and to decide to be a lawyer and to deal with political parties between a male and female and female, to a horizontal level and to make a decision-making.
At the end of this initiative, and we're successful.
Women won 175 percent of the national war in the first elections since 52 years.
But slowly, the euphorism of elections and the entire revolution, because every day we started to get into new news messages from violence.
So a morning we went to the ban of pre-war mosques and Sufi leaders.
In another morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
In another morning, the suicide victim was signed by the Army.
And in fact, every day, we were facing the rule of the bripower and their ongoing competitors against the rights of the rights of the people and their defenses of rules and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary mind, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice, social justice, that they had at the beginning.
Intoleration, rejection and revenge became the icon of the "Folute Age of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success of our disclosure and elections.
In fact, I'm here today to admit that we, as a nation, made the wrong choice and wrong choices.
We made our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety in Lybia.
Have the re-expowers and the shift between female and male leaders and national acumen?
No, it didn't.
What is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and purpose, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only ones that missed, but the female values of compassion, the Goffade and the unfinished.
Our society needs to expand a national dialogue and consensus as it took the elections that had only been strengthed to the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerically, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop acting on the name of the anger and ask one day to drive.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the gedade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just blame the next values, but also compartmentally: Goffade instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than rejection.
These are the ideals that desperately desperately desperately desperately need to get peace from war.
Because peace has an alchemie, and in this alchemie, it's about the causal of the feminist and the maskal view.
That's the real thing.
And we need to do this in general, before we do it sociologically.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace <unk> "is the word of the Good God, swear."
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all the late-durial traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "phus" and symbolizes the mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother-in-law that surrenders all of humanity, the male and the female, all of the tribes that were all over.
And just like the mother's assaults that grows in him, completely reserved the underlying sense of compassion.
And so we said, "My Gnade is all about it."
And so I said, "My Gnade has been in front of my lell."
Are we all going to be saved by the ges.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Ilung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside there, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until I could make a change of everything.
and I saw a public movement for seven years, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from my sister from a colleague of mine.
And he said, "If you're going to get this guy here, our five family members will not be more on the world because we've been eating nothing anymore for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly, I went back to the train station, and I saw some horrible things that I can't delete from my memory.
A bleeding woman was on the ground, and a broken child in her arm looked helplessly in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy taking care of themselves and their families.
In the mid-'80s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were in the victims, and many others were only surviving because they ate grass, beetles and tree cortex.
So electricity accidents have become more and more likely to be worse in the night, except the lights of China on the other side of the carrier that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the amole, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very scary, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw the bodies moving in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the devastating majority of famine to the distant relatives of China.
I just thought that I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as a Northstastern refugee, but soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Asian refugees are seen in China as illegal migrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a horrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my greatest nightmare was true when I was caught up from the Chinese police police and sent into the police department.
Somebody was harassing to being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese scores and asked me many more questions.
I had such fear, I thought, I would explode my heart.
If anything unnatural, I could be locked in and unaware of it.
I thought that was the end of my life, but I made it possible to control my feelings and answered the questions.
After they finished with questions, a prosecutor said to the other, "That was a false thing.
She's not North Korean warrior."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans, in China, in foreign messages likeyl, but many of them are caught and rejected by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they got caught, they eventually were released because of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, many of the North Koreans are caught in China, and they are attacked by North Korea, where they were tortured, or they were being executed in public.
Even though I had my fortune of escape, many of the other North Koreans are not like this.
It's tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identity and having to fight hard for survival.
Even after they learn a new language, and they found work, their world can be put on a moment in the head.
So after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life.
In my South Korea, a greater challenge was when I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I realized that the difference between North and South Korea is the big difference.
We are all Korean, but in the inside, we've been very closely interacted in part of it, because of 67 years of part.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Even though I didn't get the adaptation of the southern Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the demonstration of university.
Just when I was so used to my new life, I got a shocking call.
North Sudan's government started to send the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible way to the path to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, and ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself back to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, to more than 2,000 miles through China, and then to South Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we've been nearly caught several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all of them, and he started asking questions.
because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were being arrested.
When my family promised me that I was in the Chinese official, and I said that they were deaf, and I was her loppy person.
He looked at me in denial, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go to the remote border, but I had to put all my money to the border of Laos.
But even after we've been over the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border destruction.
After I had paid money and paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family got replicated, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the largest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything to help my family to defend freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested, just before the South Korean message.
I went and went from the Department of Defense and the police department, and I was trying to liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without killing, he went to a bank machine, and paid money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I gave him all the way to my heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I'm going to help the Northstanan people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger who have been well-organized to me a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately to help me, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I got together in South Korea, but the freedom to get a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the language, the workforce and the many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family workers, and we send them information and money to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be more hopeful to fight North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, including at the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce my brothers to you.
Remi is 22, and very good sights.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not be.
Remi knows what love is.
He's sharing them in ruthless, and he's sharing them in the face of the road.
It's not delicious. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to speak to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16th. He's very good.
He has absolutely meaningless memory.
But he also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate, but he remembers the paper year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while he was the first result of the teombet on my arm and had Magas's birthday.
Don't they listen incredibly?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood wrong.
But what my heart empowered and my soul was that, although that was the case, even though they didn't get used to be used to be used, it only could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the termism, it's a complex function of the brain that affects social communication and sometimes physical abilities.
It's different in each individual, and it's different in the same way that Remi is different than Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes of autism is discovered, and even though it's one of the fastest growing development disorders of the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've met autism, but I can't remember it any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He cried a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and he actually seemed to be very interested in me.
Remi lived and re-downed in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy on the smallest things, like cars in a row of the room, to eat the washing machine and eat everything that came in.
And when he grew older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the homony and the never-for-off hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being never lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I would not want to trade against normality.
Considence is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift in it. And in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edcheron has been filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo, a robot that's actually filled with a robotic machine and with a long time of a millionth of time.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-T photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make the slow-term-up of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at the outside of our field, or without an <unk>-ray image in your body, and really ask what we could do with "Canyon."
Now, if I take a laser clip and turn it into a billionth of a second, and that's several Femtoseconds -- I'm going to create a package of photons that hardly much bigger and that photons are wide, and this one of these photons, this project will move in speed, and as a million times faster than a new project.
So if you take this project, this photons package, and you take it into that bottle, like these photons are going to break into the bottle?
What's the light in slow motion?
So, this whole event --
So think about it, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosis event -- so long the light is required to get back to this track -- but I'm trying to get this video to do 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photoncatch, which starts to move through and then break through the inside.
And part of the light is coming out of the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually get the juice of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going to be flowing around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread on the table, and because of the reflection of the screen, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a normal project and you can take it back the same track, and you slow the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you've got to sit here to see the movie?
Day one week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And how about something still-time photography?
You can see again, like these waves of the table, that flush the wheel and the wall over the back.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature of the picture, one of the other things that I did, is, of course, is that our eye is a mixed image.
But if you look at this Tomate again, you'll see that when the light blows up, it's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is on and the light goes around in and back again, and after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this Femto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if you're a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, when a photographer knows, if you're doing a photo with a short amount of time of time, you have very little light, but we're going to have a billion times faster than your shortest possible time of time, so you're getting as good as no light.
So what we do is we send this project, this photons package, a million times, and we're drawing it again with very clever synchronization, and we're going to combine this gigabytes of data to make this Ftotototo video that I showed you.
And we can take all of these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes: can you see corners?
The idea is that we're going to put a little bit of light on the door.
It's going to be distracted, it's going to go into the space, and part of it will be reflected back on the door, and eventually we could use this more nuanced light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
And behind the wall, a soup is hidden, and we're going to let the light down on the door.
After our paper was published in the Proction Communications department, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to cut this light project and we're going to put it in the wall, and we're going to put it in the wall, and this photons's going to be kind of rounded into all directions, and some of the photons will be able to break our hidden soup that will break light, and then then then then the door of the wall of light, and then they're going to be slightly different at the very moment.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femtoto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time solution, and it can look at the world in the speed of light.
And so, of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is,
So by adding a laser to a laser, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to put them together and try to analyze the different light-making, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our design process.
We've got a little bit to do this before we can do this in the lab in practice, we could build cars that are going to avoid collisions, and see what's on the curve, or we can look for it in dangerous levels of survivors by looking at light, by turning light through the open window, or we can build endcopes that are able to see deep in the body of the sky and also see the can see the canyon.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, that's very challenging, so that's really a roll call for scientists to think about Femto- Photographer, because a new visualization process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edillon, a scientist, a scientist, has become a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we're using every time is not just a new form of scientific processing. We can create a new form of computer photography, and color memory, and colorscopy, and we can see all of those things that are not just the wave.
But it's also something weird about this.
If you look at these waves under the bottles of the bottles, you can see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've almost been able to take light at the speed, odd effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly incredible.
The order to do the evidence in the world is to turn into the camera in a more order, so by taking the overall relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So whether for photography to focus around corners or create a new visualization for medicine or new composition, since our invention, we've been able to completely open up all the data and detail on our website and hope that the driver-makers, the creative community, and the research community, we should stop to stop that we should start to start to make the megipels of the next one-dimensional perspective, to the next one-dimensional perspective, to the next one-dimensional perspective, to the
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet each neighbor on the street so many of the things that we don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the past years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors, and to use things like a stick, to use the clones and the chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much rent do my neighbors pay?
How can we borrow more things without worrying each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for endless houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is tied from the giant flower that had been filled with the loved ones for hundreds of years, drunk and haist and haistles. I trust a city where music is always alive.
I think every time anyone never ever did, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most remaining parts of America.
I live in the near of this house, and I thought about how I can get it, and I thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpectedly.
I thought a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I'm interested in in in my life right now.
But it's hard to keep this view every day.
It's easy to lose your daily lives and to forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I transformed a side of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard, and I wrote with a crider of the gaps: "I want to die," I want to be like, everyone who can come back, can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and to share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day was completely filled with the wall, and she grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people in the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to stand on a broad-time line on the International Record."
"I'm going to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live in green."
"I'm going to die, I want to keep them in my arms."
"I'm going to die, I want to be someone's Kavallill."
"I'm going to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of the people brought me to laugh, to the wine and the quiet times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new way to understand.
It's about creating space for participation and thinking and remembering what's most important to us while growing and changing.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of the messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a building and I've now built a building in the world like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to engage our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at the things with the right view and think about that life is short and sensitive.
We're often punished to talk about death, or just thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strength most strength of us.
The idea of death is that we have life.
Our common places are best about what we care about as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, fears and stories, people can not only help us to create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in cognitive mathematics. I think a very special problem for anyone who is involved in this with the idea of being a corporate servant.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try and explain what I'm doing.
Teaching is one of the most human activity.
We are excited about looking at the clysterical balletters and the loans of the bus, as you're going to see.
So for a ballet, there's an extraordinarily large amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary capacity. It also makes it with my fellow rabcondels that had been a ballet of action at the time.
and over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to survive with the unconditionable symptoms like weakness, stumble, and semen, and other people who are living more, and so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
In trouble, there's no kind of a biomarking of Parkinson's activity, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test with neurossychologists.
You have to do it in the clinic. It's very expensive, and that means, outside clinical trials, it never happens. Never ever did.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would be a trained tour in the hospital, and what if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't be expensive to the hospital.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurologic area.
So I want to suggest to you a non-conventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual, virtual illusions like my fellow Janricuts.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal muscles.
This is what happens in the normal condition, when someone creates speech sounds, we can look at it as a playful ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we make sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And how ballet needs a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it's learning.
And by the way we can compare the position of the vibrating mood, and as the receiver is also affected by the mental organs of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the underlying shell of the bottom line.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Simp, weakness, weakness, sininess.
The language is even more and more colorful, and this is an example of psychicot.
And this is a simple effect of the voice, sometimes with digital microphones and the perimeter and the collision system, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now see where someone is standing in a bind between disease and health, just because of the sounds of the deer.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test in neurologists.
It's so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are exactly right. They're not going to do the right thing with experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something extremely cheap, you can also use it in a very high scale.
Now, these amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the clinic.
We can get objective data through advanced observation.
We can do low-cost mass-scale treatments for clinical trials, and we can get the first study of the entire population to be able to be able to be able to do it.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's brain-based framework.
With Aculab and PatientsLMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough input data for those goals.
We have synpolars that are accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, with no Parkinson's, can be able to quit a few cents for a few seconds. I'm very familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of it, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the call call says, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. Okay.
Some of them may not be able to get it to the end.
But we're gathering a huge database, in many circumstances, which is interesting. Those conditions are important, because we're involved in this, to figure out what the neural markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is true?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to give him a little bit of a job, because he did so amazing work -- now it's also working on the mobile network, which allows this project to be able to allow, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call improvement.
That means that people can call the phone, and they can do the test. People could call Parkinson's license their voice so that your doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. MaxSte, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a small-scale area in the south, which means that wildlife animals can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night, and I woke up in the morning and I found her dead. It was horrible. It was our only Buumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the Masai, believes that we came together with our animals and the open ocean of the sky, so our animals so much.
I learned to hate lions in the past of my child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our fathers. They are also involved in this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for six and nine years for the cows of his father. That's how I did.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't get on. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to do it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to go next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird flies, you go back, but you come back to the next time, and you come, and you say, this thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they're reaching, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I took the Stall. I walked around the hand with a packle, and that's what the lion didn't get.
Pamine fears of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I used to work on my room all day, and I once again took the new radio of my mother, and one day, she almost brought me around. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a direct drive from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn to the right or the left.
And I turned out a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights down.
This is a little black lamp from a broken flaw.
And then I built everything together.
The solar membrane produces the battery that provides electricity to the correct power. I call it a composition.
And the right-being is blind.
You can see that the lion is out of the outside, because there's the lion.
And so this is what happens for lions when they come.
The lights glow and the lions believe that I'm going to go around the rubble. And that's what I used to do all the time in bed.
Thank you.
I've been running this in our homes, and since then we had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped from it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. They can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators such as hyena or leopard seals, and the lights are also about keeping elephants from farms.
My invention helped me come to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helping to deal with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights, where there is no one, and I'm going to show the people how to use them.
One year ago, I was just a boy from the savanna who was crying the cows, and I saw planes on me and said, "I'm going to sit in one day!"
And here I am.
I had to draw with an airplane to my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to be following lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and the lions are able to cooperate, on the side, with the lions without arguments.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next to the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. An excellent electrode?
Yes, I know electric fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it again, not true -- yeah, I've tried to do it again, but I've been able to give back to the try, because I got a stroke.
All right, Richard Turder is hard. You're special.
We're going to hire you to each step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and I didn't have one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting.
To be honest, most of them have been shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I gave my daughter to my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 and five.
And so we were back in New York a year later, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on ...
When my wife came up to the third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and make a father's granddad's brother account to keep the ritual going on?"
And then we started asking tourists to make a picture of us at the time.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you get a completely stranger to your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody is never really touched by our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much of these travels would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is only weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a handful of a moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a way for us to keep time in October a week, and to change our time and how we've been from year to year, not just physically, but to reflect in everything.
Because while we do the same image, our perspective of time is changing, while they're always reaching new fragments, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything, and how they see it.
And this very intense time that we spend in common is something we appreciate and expect to be silent every year.
Recently, while one of our trips, we went for a walk, and suddenly they stayed like it, and it shows a red bar on a dollet that she had learned to love as a little child in earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was a five-year-old person at the exact exact same point.
She said that she remembers her being in the chest when she saw the store for the first time, nine years ago.
And now she looks at high school schools in New York, because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized it was clear: The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know how it looks like in your mind, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm barely a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes this picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come into the picture and not dare you ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
